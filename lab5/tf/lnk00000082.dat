       Faint Young Sun
       Here's a climate puzzle -- one that goes back to Earth's infancy some 4.5 billion to 2.5 billion years ago. The sun was much dimmer back then. Far less solar radiation reached the planet.
       Earth should have been a frozen wasteland. But all geologic signs point to a young planet awash in liquid water, with the first life-forms emerging. Scientists call this conundrum the

       A Different Kind of Smart
       Zola the crow is about to face a test that has baffled animals from canaries to dogs.
       She's a wild New Caledonian crow, and for the first time, she's seeing a tidbit of meat dangling on a long string tied to a stick. She perches on the stick, bends down, grabs the string
       with her beak and pulls. But the string is too long. The meat still hangs out of reach. 04.18.13 | more >>

       The Human Brainome Project
       Brain research has been on a lot of minds lately in the nation's capital. After offering a brief shout-out to Alzheimer's research in his February State of the Union address, President
       Barack Obama went a step further in April by announcing a decade-long effort to develop advanced tools for tracking human brain activity. The administration dubbed it the Brain Research

       Ignition Failed
       If all goes according to Mike Dunne's plan, the United States will build its first nuclear fusion power plant by the end of the next decade. Sixteen times a second, as the National Ignition
       Facility's program director for laser fusion energy envisions it, a two-millimeter-wide capsule of cryogenic hydrogen will drop into a steel chamber and get zapped by a 384-beam laser.

       Dose of Reality
       There are two vaccines that guard against human papillomavirus, and they are in rare company among medical inventions -- the vaccines prevent cancer. Only the hepatitis B vaccine can make
       the same claim. Cancer-causing HPV can trigger abnormal cell growth on the cervix, and cervical cancer still kills up to 4,000 U.S. women each year. The virus is also implicated in cancers

       As Erebus Lives and Breathes
       MCMURDO STATION, ANTARCTICA -- Even when the December sun beats down 24 hours a day, most of Antarctica remains cold, if not brutally frigid. With one dramatic exception. Wind-blown clouds
       of steam rise year-round from a lava lake atop Mount Erebus, the planet's southernmost active volcano. 03.20.13 | more >>

       From Great Grandma to You
       Like many women with parents of the Mad Men generation, Susan Murphy grew up in a household full of cigarette smoke. Both dad and mom smoked heavily, even while Murphy was still in her
       mother's womb. 03.20.13 | more >>

       Quakes in Slo-Mo
       Herb Dragert didn't know what to make of his wayward station.
       In the early days of GPS satellites, Dragert had set up four benchmarks in the bedrock of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, to watch how their positions changed over time. Maybe, he
       thought, he could capture the ground moving during the earthquakes that occasionally shake the Pacific Northwest. 03.07.13 | more >>

       Of Mice and Man
       It looked like a lost cause: a 61-year-old patient with advanced pancreatic cancer -- one of the deadliest diagnoses. Ordinarily, doctors wouldn't have much choice. They could try
       chemotherapy drugs one at a time to see if any worked, or they could slam the tumor with a cocktail of chemicals that had shown some success with similar cases. 03.07.13 | more >>

       A Cancer Patient's Best Friend
       Daisy Martin didn't seem sick. Come dinnertime, she was as ravenous as ever. And at the sight of a new toy, she danced around in excited circles, same as always. Then one day, when Daisy
       was 8 years old, one of her family members noticed a lump, and then others, on the side of Daisy's neck, beneath her fur. The diagnosis was devastating: T-cell lymphoma, a cancer so
       merciless that ... 02.21.13 | more >>

       The 3-D Printing Revolution
       Joshua Pearce takes unusual satisfaction in strolling through Walmart. The shelves laden with toys, household items, tools and clothing inspire in him a certain smugness, a pride in
       American entrepreneurship. But it's not because Pearce admires the chain as an empire built by a self-made man. Pearce swells with pride at Walmart because the store is full of
       mass-manufactured objects that he ... 02.20.13 | more >>

       No New Meds
       Psychiatry seemed poised on the edge of a breakthrough. In early 2011, after decades of no radically new drugs, a fundamentally different schizophrenia treatment promised relief from the
       psychotic hallucinations and delusions plaguing people with the disease. The new compound, devised by chemists at Eli Lilly and Co., hit a target in the brain that older medicines had
       ignored. 02.07.13 | more >>

       Salvage Job

       Disorder at Work
       Richard Kriwacki refused to give up on his protein. He had tried again and again to determine its three-dimensional shape, but in every experiment, the protein looked no more structured
       than a piece of cooked spaghetti. 01.24.13 | more >>

       Urban Eyes
       Rogers Hornsby, one of the best hitters ever to swing a baseball bat, had a reputation for being standoffish. Teammates complained that he didn't socialize, even balking at attending movies
       -- prime entertainment during the 1920s. Sitting in a dark theater watching a bright screen made it difficult to hit a baseball, Hornsby used to say. Hard to argue with a guy who reportedly

       Group to Group
       Photographer Bill Wallauer was following a group of chimpanzees in Tanzania's Gombe Stream National Park one March day when a young female caught his eye. She had climbed a tree, inserted a
       thin, peeled branch into a hole and was fishing out carpenter ants. Wallauer, of the Jane Goodall Institute, took out his video camera and filmed the chimp as she slurped up insects for
       several minutes. 01.24.13 | more >>

       Little Mind Benders
       Imagining tiny creatures infiltrating human brains is creepy enough. But Marion Vittecoq knows she has been invaded. Her inner companions may be just hanging out -- or they may be subtly
       changing her personality, manipulating her behavior or altering her risk of disease. Yet she doesn't sound particularly upset. 01.10.13 | more >>

       Heart of the Matter
       A golden age for the neutrino is dawning.

       Factory of Life
       Quietly, on the top floor of a nondescript commercial building overlooking Boston Harbor, the future is being born.
       Rows of young scientists tap intently in front of computer monitors, their concentration unbroken even as the occasional plane from Logan Airport buzzes by. State-of-the-art lab equipment
       hums away in the background. This office, in Boston's Marine Industrial Park, is what California's Silicon Valley was four decades ago -- the vanguard of an industry that will change your
       life. 12.27.12 | more >>

       Higgs discovery helps make sense of matter
       2012 SCIENCE NEWS TOP 25: 1 It's hard enough to muster a standing-room-only crowd for a physics talk, let alone an overnight queue. But on the night of July 3, scientists sacrificed sleep
       to line up outside the main auditorium at CERN, the particle physics laboratory near Geneva. Their goal: get a seat to hear Joe Incandela. It wasn't the laconic, gray-suited scientist they
       had lined up ... 12.13.12 | more >>
