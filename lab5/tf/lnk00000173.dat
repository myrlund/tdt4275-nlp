   2012 SCIENCE NEWS TOP 25: 1
   It's hard enough to muster a standing-room-only crowd for a physics talk, let alone an overnight queue. But on the night of July 3, scientists sacrificed sleep to line up outside the main
   auditorium at CERN, the particle physics laboratory near Geneva. Their goal: get a seat to hear Joe Incandela. It wasn't the laconic, gray-suited scientist they had lined up for, though.
   Incandela, a particle physicist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, was expected to be the first to unveil the biggest physics news in years.

   At 9 o'clock the next morning, with the auditorium packed, Incandela launched into a flood of charts and graphs. Blips in the data represented what happened when proton beams slammed into one
   another in CERN's mammoth particle collider. Buried in this data was one blip representing a subatomic celebrity that scientists had been hunting for years -- the Higgs boson.

   Incandela didn't disappoint. "We're seeing something; it's relatively significant," he told the anxious onlookers.

   He clicked to the next slide. The blip grew bigger. There it was: the Higgs. The room erupted in applause.

   The next speaker, CERN's Fabiola Gianotti, only strengthened the case when she unveiled her team's evidence.

   In many ways, that moment at CERN was the culmination of decades of scientific questing. Finding the Higgs meant that physicists had finally succeeded in explaining why the universe looks the
   way it does (SN: 7/28/12, pp. 5, 26 & 28). Their framework of the universe at the subatomic scale was complete.

   "When it comes to discovering the ultimate workings of reality, the easy part is now officially over," says Sean Carroll, a theoretical physicist at Caltech. "We've put the finishing touches on
   a complete theory of the matter we see around us in our everyday lives."

   Now that most scientists agree the Higgs is here, they can begin to map uncharted realms, from the possibility of extra dimensions of space and time to massive, secretive particles that shadow
   those already known.

   Ultimately, the Higgs particle is important because it helps explain mass. It and the closely related Higgs field are the reason the universe didn't remain a sea of massless particles after the
   Big Bang.

   Just nanoseconds after the cosmos was born, a field permeating all of space switched on. This was the Higgs field (named, like the particle, after University of Edinburgh physicist Peter Higgs,
   one of several scientists who dreamed up the idea in the 1960s). Suddenly some of the particles zipping around hit the Higgs field and slowed down, like marbles rolling through honey. That
   slowdown endowed them with mass. Once they had mass and could properly stick together, particles could combine and congeal into the atoms and molecules that make up everything from stars to
   people.

   Only some of the particles slowed down; others, like photons, can buzz right through the Higgs field and thus still have no mass.

   No wonder physicists have been hunting the Higgs for so long. But scientists can't spot the Higgs field directly; they can only deduce its existence by detecting the Higgs boson. A boson is a
   type of particle often closely linked to a force, and the Higgs boson emerges from the Higgs field (illustrated at left).

   And the only way to observe a Higgs boson today, nearly 14 billion years after the Big Bang, is to create one in high-energy smashups at particle accelerators. For decades, nobody had a
   powerful enough machine to generate the energies required.

   Accelerators such as the Tevatron at Fermilab, outside Chicago, took a shot at it. Einstein's equation E=mc² says that energy and mass are interchangeable. Smash two particles together at high
   enough energies, say nearly the speed of light, and an even more massive particle can pop into existence.

   The Tevatron helped narrow the range of masses the Higgs might have, but it took CERN's bigger Large Hadron Collider to shake the Higgs loose. Out of every trillion collisions between protons,
   perhaps one created the rare, unstable Higgs -- which quickly decayed to other kinds of particles.

   Peering into sprays of debris from 500 trillion proton collisions, two detectors independently spotted signatures of Higgs decay. Working backward from the particle debris, scientists
   calculated that the Higgs has the mass of about 133 protons.

   To convince themselves they were seeing true Higgs decays, the CERN physicists set themselves a rigorous statistical standard. They required a level of certainty known as five sigma, which
   holds that there is a 1-in-3.5-million chance that a statistical fluke could have created a signal of the observed magnitude or greater. At the time of the CERN announcement, both Higgs
   detectors independently achieved the five-sigma level; the statistical strength has only increased since, with both detectors now between six and seven sigma.

   Still, current theories predict a very specific set of behaviors for the Higgs, and it's not yet clear whether the particle found at CERN meets those. The discovery may yet turn out to be a
   close cousin, rather than an identical twin, to the particle that Peter Higgs predicted. Scientists have been posting papers almost daily at arXiv.org, an online forum for new research not yet
   in journals, exploring the consequences of what a non-standard model Higgs might mean -- from limiting the scope of other theories to raising the possibility of brand-new particles never before
   dreamed of.

   If so, physicists will need new theories to explore what's going on. That may take years: Their best tool, the LHC, is scheduled to shut down in early 2013 for an upgrade that could take up to
   two years. It will come back with more than 50 percent more energy.

   That ultimate energy should be enough for physicists to distinguish between the several Higgs possibilities. There may even turn out to be not one but many kinds of Higgs particles, each with a
   different mass.

   An LHC running at full bore may also be able to answer one of the biggest puzzles about the collider so far: why it hasn't spotted any evidence of supersymmetry, a theory that holds that all
   the particles in the ordinary world have a heavy partner lurking nearby. Supersymmetry could explain why the mass of the Higgs boson isn't infinite, as standard model math would have it.
   Supersymmetry could also mean that the Higgs itself has its own massive superpartner particle. Powering up to higher energies will let the LHC probe the possibilities of this shadowy
   otherworld, if it exists.
   "This isn't the end of the story," says Fermilab physicist Rob Roser, "but the beginning of a new chapter in science."

     * I am really impressed by this news about the Higgs boson and its part in the completion of the Standard Model of particle physics. My personal opinion counts for very little, however, I
       would really like to know how all that we know now about the existence of the Higgs fits in with the Garrett Lisi via of the physics via his brilliant E8 model.

     * Quote "Peter Higgs, one of several scientists who dreamed up the idea in the 1960s" unquote - Yes dreaming is the right word.
       As long as physicists cannot explain the forces with one underlying theory they are living in a dream world. Phycists made a great job in documenting the ineteractions and finding short
       lived resonances in space of which the Higgs boson is one of many - that it is fundamental I doubt. For instance, the simple explanation why the electron-proton interaction emmits/absorbs a
       photon is not explained - other by an it-is-so based on energy conservation rules but can anyone describes exactly how kinetic or potential energy take on the enrgy form of a photon? Other
       than by the wavy line on a Feynman diagram.
       And so we have, with the Higgs discovery, another it-is-maybe-so confirmed into an it-is-so. May the quantum honey which slows the particles be sweet - I somehow expect it to become very
       bitter soon.

     * Careful and objective scientists do not say the Higgs boson has been discovered yet. That remains to be seen.
       Firstly, what has been discovered is an unstable Higgs-like boson resonance which could be a fairly boring repeat of the hundreds of other unstable boson resonances already found.
       Secondly, there are a number of anomalies within the existing data, especially diphoton rates that are too high, and the fact that no spin has been definitively determined yet.
       Thirdly, the most recent LHC results indicate differing boson resonance masses for different decay processes, which no one understands yet, and most hope will disappear somehow.
       Lastly, before the LHC came on-line, the predictions for the Higgs mass ranged from about 100 GeV to 800 GeV!!!
       After the fact of finding a bump at 125 GeV THEN they single out the predictions that conform to that result! That is not cricket in science.
       Particle physicist Jon Butterworth commented in Nature recently:
       "If one assembles the standard model without fine-tuning some parameters, quantum effects mean that the Higgs boson's mass should grow and end up near the Planck scale. This is clearly
       wrong, and it hints at gaps in the theory."
       One could well get the impression that there is something seriously amiss in the current particle physics paradigm. The Higgs Mechanism sounds like a corny just-so story and is completely
       untestable in any direct manner.

     * Article Quote:
       "Ultimately, the Higgs particle is important because it helps explain mass. It and the closely related Higgs as a force field are the reason the universe didn't remain a sea of massless
       particles after the Big Bang"
       What l would like to know is, as a non scientist, Where, and how does this intelligence and organisation come from?
       Yes, l understand it comes from the Higgs, but it has been named the " God" particle in laymans terms, ( could they be one and the same? ) so to me it seems that either it has been created
       by an external force of energy, intelligence and organisation or is internal, ie,intrinsic in everything.
       l write poetry, but am also very interested in science. l wrote a letter once to someone on the subject, with my poem included, so l hope you can publish it, as l believe many people will
       find it interesting - and thought provoking, scientist too! Here follows:
       l was interested to hear that you do not believe in religion, but l wondered if you believe in a higher power, a God or by whichever name you want to call it ie , cosmic
       consciousness/intelligence or simply a process. l actually write poetry and have had 5 published in various anthologies, but l can only write when l feel inspired. l hope you don`t mind but
       l`d like to share one of them with you.
       This is it:
       There is no Division.
       There is no division
       Between science and religion
       either there is an external God,
       Who created everything
       or an internal force
       Of pure consciousness,
       intelligence, energy and organisation.
       This internal force,
       resides within every atom,
       Regulating and organising,
       with accuracy and intelligence
       And is the outward manifestation
       of a divine force or God.
       l hope you like it. Almost every time l read an article on any aspect of science, including the formation of the universe l also read that most scientists deny the existence of a God
       Although l, like you, am not religious, believing that religions cause all the suffering and wars in this world, because people are not intelligent or mature enough to agree to differ on
       matters of belief, l certainly acknowledge, not believe, that for the universe and everything contained in it to have evolved and to exist in its present form, that there must be an
       intelligent, organising force at work and l am sure that all scientists would agree with that.
       lt seems to me as a non scientific but intelligent human being that either this force is A, outside of everything, controlling, organising, regulating ect, with accuracy and intelligence,
       an external "God" if you like, or B, is within every particle of every piece of matter as its intrinsic, organising principle ie. the essence of everything, self regulating.
       One could make a comparison with a computer. l don`t think anyone who knows how it works would say that there was no designer or someone who input information. lf, hypothetically, that was
       proved not to be the case, then people would look at the possibility that the computer was self-organising and intelligent.
       lt may not be that good a comparison but l think that you get the "gist" ( idea) of it --- it can only be one or the other --- it has to be.
       l also think that a lot of confusion/misconception surrounds the perception of the word "God". ls " he" really an old man with a white beard and mysterious ways, controlling our destiny? Or
       do more people see "him" as a force , or form, of energy, intelligence and organisation which is intrinsic in and the essence of, everything?
       What we call it is irrelevant --- it is what it is, and to me it seems more like a process in action than a person, to which all living things can connect, through thought, prayer ect, in
       fact one huge mass of universal consciousness, which, as scientists do not really know where exactly consciousness resides ie, only in the brain ---- l don`t think so -- is as good a
       hypothesis as any.
       l hope my views have given some food for thought as l know the very difficult and ultimate search, by myself and others as well as scientists worldwide,is for the "Truth". However l know
       that "truth" is relative but l also hope it is universal and conclusive. ( one day! )

     * The Higgs field -- elementary particles and force carriers, bosons -- during the Bang, probably traveling slower, interacted with lighter particles traveling faster. The higher mass Higgs
       was ahead of the lighter particles? What about masses after interactions with other normal matter?
