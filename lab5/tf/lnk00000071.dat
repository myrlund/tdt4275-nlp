     * Geologists develop weapons to combat that sinkhole feeling
       Earth in Action | By Alexandra Witze
       What do five Porsches, several Kentucky thoroughbreds and a three-story building in Guatemala City have in common? They've all been swallowed by sinkholes. 04.15.13 | more >>
     * Reports of junk DNA's 'demise' were based on junky logic and dubious definitions
       Randomness | By Tom Siegfried
       Science is an oddly successful enterprise. On the whole, it provides an impressive guide to reality. From antibiotics and atomic bombs to laser beams and X-rays, science enables humans to
       forge powerful tools from nature's secrets. 04.08.13 | more >>
     * Humankind's destructive streak may be older than the species itself
       Becoming Human | By Erin Wayman
       Some scientists have proposed designating a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene, that would cover the period since humans became the predominant environmental force on the planet. But
       when would you have it begin? Some geologists argue that the Anthropocene began with the Industrial Revolution, when fossil fuel consumption started influencing climate. Others point back
       several thousand ... 04.01.13 | more >>
     * A theorem in limbo shows that QED is not the last word in a mathematical proof
       Math Trek | By Julie Rehmeyer
       When a top-tier mathematician announced in August that he had proved one of the greatest problems in mathematics, the claim was trumpeted in the New York Times, Nature, Science and the
       Boston Globe. 03.25.13 | more >>
     * Explanations for time's arrow keep marching on
       Randomness | By Tom Siegfried
       Time after time, physicists have tried to explain time. Many claim to have succeeded. But they haven't. Otherwise everybody would quit trying to explain it all over again.

     * When trolls come out from under their bridges, it's bad news for scientific discourse
       Culture Beaker | By Rachel Ehrenberg
       Depending on your age, the word troll might evoke a nasty creature who lives under a bridge -- or a nasty creature who posts inflammatory comments online. The former, found mostly in
       Scandinavian folktales, is typically a dim-witted beast, not inclined to help humans. The latter (judgment on wits aside) is also rarely considered helpful. But new research suggests a more
       nefarious role for ... 03.12.13 | more >>
     * When an asteroid heads for Earth, it's time to reconsider those doomsday plans
       Earth in Action | By Alexandra Witze
       Chicken Little is right. The sky is falling.
       The million-plus people living in Chelyabinsk, Russia, got that message on February 15, when a space rock some 17 meters across detonated over their homes. People rushed to the windows in
       wonderment as a blaze of light arced through the sky; seconds later many of them got a face full of glass shards. It was the most damaging cosmic collision since 1908, when an even bigger
       asteroid chunk blew ... 03.07.13 | more >>
     * Real-life Maxwell's demon adds fuel to debate about status of the second law
       Randomness | By Tom Siegfried
       Fight Club had its First Rule (don't talk about Fight Club). The Transporter enforces Rule Number 1 (never change the deal). And NCIS Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs observes Rule 1 (never
       mix the suspects together in the same room). 03.07.13 | more >>
     * A mathematician puts Fermat's Last Theorem on an axiomatic diet
       Math Trek | By Julie Rehmeyer
       Fermat's Last Theorem is so simple to state, but so hard to prove. Though the 350-year-old claim is a straightforward one about integers, the proof that University of Oxford mathematician
       Andrew Wiles finally created for it nearly two decades ago required almost unimaginably complex theoretical machinery. The proof was a dazzling demonstration of that machinery's value, but
       one aspect of ... 02.20.13 | more >>
     * Poll of quantum physicists shows agreement, disagreement and something in between
       Randomness | By Tom Siegfried
       Science is not a democracy. Nature's laws are not subject to the whims of popular vote. A scientific theory succeeds by providing logical explanations for puzzling phenomena and making
       correct predictions about the outcomes of new experiments. It doesn't matter how many scientists believed in the theory beforehand (or even afterward, for that matter). 02.20.13 | more >>
     * In Hollywood, buzz beats star power when it comes to predicting box office take
       Culture Beaker | By Rachel Ehrenberg
       Movie studios love awards season. Winning one of the glittery statuettes that are annually bestowed upon those in the biz can provide a hefty box office boost. But if you are going to put
       money on which movies will sell the most tickets in the long run, accolades from critics and peers aren't a very good crystal ball. When it comes to predicting box office success, it turns
       out that the ... 02.07.13 | more >>
     * A new generation of antidepressants could help patients feel better faster
       Frame of Mind | By Laura Sanders
       People talk a lot about speeding up drug development. But for some problems, they should also focus on speeding up the drugs. For brain disorders like depression, the medicines prescribed
       by doctors can take weeks or months to kick in. (And even after the long wait, the number of people who experience complete turnarounds is surprisingly low.) 02.01.13 | more >>
     * Rules for computing classical probabilities might depend on quantum randomness
       Randomness | By Tom Siegfried
       For all the deference to "laws" of nature that supposedly govern everything that happens, the truth is that randomness rules the world. 01.23.13 | more >>
     * Italian earthquake verdict exposes rifts between science and society
       Earth in Action | By Alexandra Witze
       Sometimes a little shake-up is exactly what scientists need to make a major breakthrough. Other times it can send them to jail. 01.23.13 | more >>
     * Devil is in the details of a new Medicare plan to buy medical supplies
       Math Trek | By Julie Rehmeyer
       Medicare could waste billions of dollars, bankrupt small businesses and leave seniors without crucial equipment like oxygen tanks and wheelchairs, some economists warn, with a new
       auction-based purchasing plan that ignores mathematical principles of competitive bidding. 01.11.13 | more >>
     * Maybe there's a way to find out if reality is a computer simulation
       Randomness | By Tom Siegfried
       In olden days, before the Star Trek holodeck and movies like TRON and The Matrix, philosophers used to wonder whether life was but a dream. Nowadays they're more concerned that reality
       could be just a computer simulation. 01.11.13 | more >>
     * Game theory suggests current climate negotiations won't avert catastrophe
       Math Trek | By Julie Rehmeyer
       Climate treaty negotiators might be wise to have a conversation with a game theorist.
       So far, negotiators' promises to reduce greenhouse gas production have been paltry and results paltrier, as both emissions and global temperatures have risen. A new game theoretic analysis
       published in the Oct. 23 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences both pinpoints why negotiations have accomplished so little and suggests how the parties might achieve better
       results. 11.13.12 | more >>
     * For what you want to know, Bayes offers superior stats
       Randomness | By Tom Siegfried
       It turns out that the old adage about statistics and damned lies wasn't a joke. Sticks and stones may be bonebreakers, and words inflict no (physical) pain, but numbers can kill.

     * Beer bubble math
       Math Trek | By Julie Rehmeyer
       The rate of change of bubble volume. If this quantity is positive, the bubble will grow; if it's negative, it will shrink. 06.10.11 | more >>

       Mind the gap: Genetic knowledge and medical power
       Comment | By James P. Evans
       Since the completion of the Human Genome Project a decade ago, much excitement has swirled around the possibility that determining a person's genetic makeup could help doctors personalize
       the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease. But James P. Evans, a physician and geneticist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, says the promises of genomic medicine
       have been ... 04.22.11 | more >>

       Better risk assessments through molecular biology
       Comment | By James P. Evans
       As director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's NexGen Program, toxicologist Ila Cote leads a collaboration that brings together data, methods, skills and brains from diverse
       fields to better understand how chemicals interact with living things and the environment. In doing so, scientists hope to answer questions about potential risks from chemical exposure more
       quickly and ... 04.08.11 | more >>
