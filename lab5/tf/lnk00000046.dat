   Altered mix of microbes might reduce susceptibility to viral infections

   By Nathan Seppa

   Web edition: April 19, 2013

   Uncircumcised men harbor more bacteria around the head of the penis than do circumcised men, and the mix of microbial species is decidedly different in the two groups, researchers find.

   Whether these changes in microbial numbers and diversity explain why circumcised men are less likely to get infected with HIV remains unclear. But the findings identify previously unknown
   differences that exist between a warm, moist environment under the foreskin and the comparatively dry surfaces found on circumcised men.

   "It's a very promising line of research," says Robert Bailey, a biologist and epidemiologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who wasn't part of the study team. "But it's far from
   really providing the story on the mechanism for the increased risk of HIV infection through the foreskin."

   The report, which appears April 16 in mBio, finds that when the foreskin is removed from the head of the penis, resident microbes become exposed to oxygen and many bacteria flee the scene.

   To measure these changes, the researchers enlisted 156 uncircumcised, married men in Uganda and obtained swabs from under each man's foreskin. Roughly half of the men were then randomly
   assigned to get circumcised. A year later, researchers again took swabs.

   While there was little difference in the penis biota in the men at the beginning of the study, the later samples revealed substantially less bacteria in the circumcised group and changes in the
   diversity of the bacteria that remained. Levels of nine kinds of anaerobic bacteria, which need an environment devoid of oxygen, had decreased.

   Circumcision provides heterosexual men with considerable, but not total, protection against infection by HIV and other sexually transmitted viruses (SN: 4/25/2009, p. 10). Does changing the
   microbiota of the penis account for this protection? "We can't say that our study answers that question, but we're definitely chipping away at it," says microbiologist Lance Price of George
   Washington University in Washington and the Translational Genomics Research Institute in Flagstaff, Ariz.

   Price and his coauthors suggest that high amounts of bacteria and the presence of poorly understood anaerobic microbes in uncircumcised men might contribute to inflammation, which would
   facilitate infection by HIV lodged in the foreskin.

   Another alternative is that having additional bacteria present might contribute to ulcerations, which also promote viral entry, suggests Bailey.

   One thing is clear, Price says. Circumcision changes the microbial ecology of the region. He offers a macroscale analogy: "If you cut down a lot of trees, you would expect the animals who live
   there to change," he says.

     * Female genitals are harder to keep healthy than men's, but we don't cut parts off baby girls to make it easier.
       It's illegal to cut off a girl's prepuce, or to make any incision on a girl's genitals, even if no tissue is removed. Even a pinprick is banned. Why don't boys get the same protection?
       Everyone should be able to decide for themselves whether or not they want parts of their genitals cut off. It's *their* body.
       Male circumcision doesn't seem to help against AIDS either. From a USAID report:
       "There appears no clear pattern of association between male circumcision and HIV prevalence--in 8 of 18 countries with data, HIV prevalence is lower among circumcised men, while in the
       remaining 10 countries it is higher."
       It's really easy to find circumcised doctors who are against circumcision, but surprisingly difficult to find male doctors in favour who weren't circumcised themselves as children.

     * Here is what they do not tell you. According to the Circumcision Resource Center, studies show that circumcision causes significant pain and trauma, behavioral and neurological changes in
       infants, potential parental stress from persistent crying (colic) of infants, disrupted bonding between parent and child, and risk of surgical complications. Other consequences of
       circumcision include loss of a natural, healthy, functioning body part, reduced sexual pleasure, potential psychological problems, and unknown negative effects that have not been studied.
       Some circumcised men resent that they are circumcised. Sexual anxieties, reduced emotional expression, low self-esteem, avoidance of intimacy, and depression are also reported. Some doctors
       refuse to perform circumcisions because of ethical reasons. Relying on presumed authorities (e.g., American Academy of Pediatrics or doctors who echo AAP views) is not sufficient because of
       personal, religious, financial, and political conflicts of interest.

     * "Altered mix of microbes might reduce susceptibility to viral infections."
       OR the complete opposite might be true. This study doesn't present any new evidence either way. Humans depend on over 700 strains of beneficial bacteria for our good health.
       In half of African nations it is the circumcised who have markedly higher HIV prevalence. Most of the US men who have died of AIDS were circumcised at birth. A 2009 WHO study by Wawer/Gray
       in Uganda showed that the men they circumcised infected their female partners 50% MORE often than the men they left intact did.
       Mass circumcision campaigns in Africa are mis-guided and dangerous.

     * Correlation =/= causation. The facts that circumcised men are less prone to HIV and have fewer microbes does not necessarily mean one contributes to the others.
       I've always figured the lack of the protective environment of the foreskin is what reduced HIV transmission - the HIV would have to enter damaged tissue pretty quickly or risk drying out.
       In the moister environment of the foreskin it makes sense that HIV can persist longer, giving the particles a greater chance of finding damaged tissue before drying out.
       I don't believe fewer bacteria contributes to HIV infection resistance, I believe it's much more likely that a dry environment is the cause for BOTH of these. That is, it's not that A leads
       to B and B leads to C, but A leads to both B and C directly.

     * How is it possible that a scientific inquiry was necessary to come to the conclusion that the bacteria living in a moist environment would be different from those living in a dry one? Has
       science lost its collective I.Q.?
