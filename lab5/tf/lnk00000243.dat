   Earth Science
     * Back to Earth

     * [crop]
       Faint Young Sun
       Scientists struggle to understand how early Earth stayed warm enough for liquid water.
       Nicolle Rager Fuller
     * As Erebus Lives and Breathes
       The Antarctica volcano's long-lived lava lake coughs up clues to the physiology of volcanoes .
     * Quakes in Slo-Mo
       Barely detectable tremors may portend major destruction.
     * Moderate climate warming could melt permafrost
       Ancient cave formations in Siberia reveal effects of warmer past on frozen ground.
     * Salvage Job
       With fertilizer prices skyrocketing, scientists scramble to recover phosphorus from waste.
     * News in Brief: Glaciers carve path for future buildup
       Previously sculpted landscapes accumulate ice more quickly than steep valleys.
     * Quakes may bring nearby rocks closer to rupture
       Lab studies could explain how a seemingly stable geologic fault can fail.
     * Antarctic subglacial drilling effort suspended
       A British-led team has called off this season's campaign to penetrate Lake Ellsworth.
     * West Antarctica warming fast
       A reconstructed temperature record from a high-altitude station shows an unexpectedly rapid rise since 1958.
     * Grand Canyon could be much older than thought
       Disputed dating of rock erosion pegs the ancient chasm as 70 million years old.
     * How the Frankenstorm came to life
       Hurricane Sandy's humble birth and growth into a monster storm hold lessons for forecasters.
     * Ozone hole at smallest size in decades
       Warm Antarctic temperatures help preserve UV-protecting layer.
     * Spanish quake linked to groundwater pumping
       Draining aquifers likely triggered 2011 tremor that killed nine people.
     * Years after big quake, Turkish fault still slip-sliding
       Creeping movement underscores the seismic danger threatening Istanbul.
     * Depths hold clues to dearth of xenon in air
       The gas doesn't dissolve well in minerals deep inside Earth, a discovery that may explain why it's also scarce in the atmosphere.
     * Intraplate quakes signal tectonic breakup
       The unusual April temblors are the latest in a massive energy release that is cleaving the Indo-Australian crustal plate in two.
     * Arctic sea ice hits record low, and keeps going
       A summer storm and thinner ice probably contributed to this year's massive melt.
     * Himalayan melt may be less than thought
       Satellite data suggest net ice loss has been modest.
     * Extreme hot spells rising
       Analyzing six decades of temperature records reveals inexorable warming and increasing episodes of extreme heat.
     * Linking magma to quakes
       Rock crystals reveal pulses of underground activity.
     * 13th century volcano mystery may be solved
       Indonesian volcano may be the culprit in the biggest eruption of the last seven millennia.
     * Defying Depth
     * Stop-and-go plate tectonics
       Early on, ancient crustal plates may have dived deep into the Earth, time and again, giving a halting start to the planetary remodeling process.
     * Greek volcano reawakens
       Potential eruption wouldn't be anything like Santorini's storied Bronze Age blowout, scientists say.
     * Big volcanoes wake up fast
       Crystal chemistry suggests magma changes quickly before a huge eruption.
     * Carbonation brings diamonds to surface
       Chemical reactions deep inside the Earth fuel magma's gem-laden upward journey.
     * Crabs hither, shrimp thither
       Biologists document surprising differences among deep-sea animals at hydrothermal vent fields.
     * Recirculation aided Gulf plume's degradation
       Two new studies help explain fate of pollutants released in the biggest offshore spill in U.S. history.
     * Weather affects timing of some natural hazards
       Seasonal patterns in earthquakes and volcanic eruptions can be linked to rain and snow in certain locations.
     * Cretaceous Thanksgiving
       A fossilized feathered dinosaur dined on bird not long before its own demise.
