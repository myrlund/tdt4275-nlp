       Home / Departments / Science Past / May 4, 2013; Vol.183 #9 / Science Past : New star dating method
       The first effective technique for measuring the ages of large numbers of stars like the sun has been developed. Providing a powerful research tool for astronomers, the new dating technique
       is based on relatively simple measurements of a single chemical element, lithium. The age calculations can be applied to both young and "ordinary" stars, as well as to the sun itself. The
       new method makes possible spotting very young stars among the myriad stars in the sky. With further development, the technique appears certain to give astronomers important evidence on such
       problems as the origin of sta... (p. 4)
