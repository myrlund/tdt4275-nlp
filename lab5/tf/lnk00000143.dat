   Infants display neural responses linked to visual awareness by 5 months of age

   Babies' brains emit electrical bursts that signal a budding awareness of the visual world by the time they are 5 months old, a new study concludes. But some researchers are skeptical that these
   neural surges correspond to conscious experience.

   From age 5 months to 15 months, the brain begins to develop the ability to register and remember sights, according to the research by cognitive neuroscientist Sid Kouider of École Normale
   Supérieure in Paris and his colleagues. The researchers showed babies images that included faces flashed increasingly slowly on a screen. They started at a speed so fast that even adults
   wouldn't consciously notice the images, and then the researchers increased the amount of time each image appeared. Infants displayed a sequence of rapid brain responses that first signaled
   unconscious and then conscious perception of faces, Kouider's team reports April 18 in Science.

   "We weren't expecting to see any evidence of a neural marker for consciousness in 5-month-olds," Kouider says. Babies at that age exhibited a weak, delayed version of a brain response that
   occurs when adults report seeing a face flashed just long enough to be consciously perceived, Kouider asserts.

   Stronger and faster brain responses corresponding to visual awareness emerged in 12- and 15-month-olds, Kouider found, although older infants still fell well short of the adult pattern.

   If further research confirms the existence of a neural marker of consciousness in babies, scientists could adapt their visual task to evaluate whether infants show brain indications of feeling
   pain during medical procedures or after receiving numbing drugs, he suggests.

   But cognitive neuroscientist Charles Nelson of Harvard Medical School sees no clear connection between the findings in infants and the electrical responses in adults' brains. "I would be
   reluctant to attribute the same mental operation, such as consciousness, to infants and adults simply because of similar patterns of brain activity," Nelson cautions.

   Electrical responses in the brain linked to sensations, thoughts and behaviors change dramatically over the first few years of life, Nelson says. The brain responses proposed by Kouider's group
   as underlying infant consciousness don't clearly correspond to those linked to visual awareness in adults, Nelson holds.

   In the new study, 5-month-olds, 12-month-olds and 15-month-olds sat on their mothers' laps while wearing an electrode-studded cap that measured electrical activity on the brain's surface. The
   babies saw three scrambled images and a woman's face, flashed on a computer screen for various amounts of time, accompanied by bell sounds for each image that created a simple melody to attract
   the infants' attention.

   In the same setup, adults don't report seeing a face and don't display a neural marker of consciousness until each image appears for nearly one-third of a second. For 12- and 15-month-olds,
   each image had to be presented for about three-quarters of a second -- and for almost one second for 5-month-olds -- for the children to indicate conscious perception by looking toward the
   faces and generating the proposed brain signature of visual awareness.

   No one has yet confirmed that a string of electrical responses in the brains of either adults or children reflects a transition from unconscious to conscious perception, remarks cognitive
   neuroscientist Teodora Gliga of the University of London's Birkbeck College. But Kouider's team has designed a way to investigate conditions under which infants, and possibly nonhuman animals,
   respond to and learn from their environments, an important achievement in itself, Gliga holds.

   That's not to say that babies can't be aware of their surroundings, as some researchers have argued. "Five-month-olds and even younger infants probably have many real-life opportunities to
   consciously process information," Gliga says.

     * People consistently seem to underrate what babies can experience. And when it comes to "evaluating whether infants show brain indications of feeling pain during medical procedures or after
       receiving numbing drugs" I just become so upset and angry. It seems to me that ANY human who has heard the sound of infants screaming during surgery where no anaesthetics are used and still
       have to ask the question of whether infants experience pain are not in touch with what it is to be human. Please read Dr Alison Gopnik's books re babies. What she and others have learned is
       quite remarkable.

     * Where does Nelson get his information that " thoughts and behaviors change dramatically over the first few years of life"? How does he know what the thoughts are of a 5 month old verses 12
       or 15 month old? Seems his critique is not well founded.

     * I think babies are aware and can make conscious decisions very early on. At his baby shower my son (two weeks old) was grabbing at the ribbons as I was unwrapping his gifts. The other
       mothers were incredulous that he was aware of what was going on and could grab at the ribbons.
       At 3 months we shopped for some new outfits and the sales lady pulled out a lovely pastel sleeper and I said that he wouldn't like that. She asked if he were our first child in a rather
       haughty voice. Yes, I said.
       I asked her to hold up two different outfits and I asked my son which one he wanted. He grabbed for the boldly colored one. I of course knew which ones he'd choose as dressing him in plain
       ones was a chore. We did this three times and the sales lady was speechless.
       Obviously most scientists are NOT mothers or if they are they are not observing and experimenting at home. No, I am not a scientist but do have a MA in Guidance and Counseling.
       The only major difference in his early life is that I was a runner the whole nine months of my pregnancy. Three miles a day. I have wondered if the extra circulation was the reason why he
       was so aware at a supposedly early age.
       No his IQ tests were only a little above average but he has a unique ability to reason. Most kids can understand A +B=C but he can continue this thinking to D, E, F and G. He is now a
       mechanical engineer. He has always been situationaly aware, even as a baby.

     * I too become very, very angry when articles like this are published consistently underestimating the capacity of babies. I commented to Science News on this same issue back in the 1970s
       when a similar article appeared. "Scientists" who are designing studies on babies should talk to parents of babies when designing their studies. They will be ale to steer the scientists to
       be able to measure the "consciousness" of babies using methods that first reveal brain indications for things parents already know the baby knows. Then they can try their own tests to see
       if these indications appear. ALWAYS
       talk to parents first when studying babies. Otherwise your gross ignorance will eventually be revealed.
