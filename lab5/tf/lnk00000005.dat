       At the Large Hadron Collider, researchers observe D mesons oscillate between particle and antiparticle.
     * No vacancy around stars
       The Milky Way's planets pack tightly around their stars, according to simulations using data from the Kepler space telescope.
     * Radiation ring around Earth mysteriously appears, then dissipates
       Space probes detect temporary transition from two radiation belts to three, possibly in response to solar activity.
     * New home for runaway black hole
       Galactic merger and ejection may have sent a cosmic wanderer through deep space.

       The object is unrelated to February 15 asteroid flyby, experts say.
     * News in Brief: Supernovas are cosmic ray factories
       Supernova remnants provide evidence that these intense stellar explosions send cosmic rays hurtling through the galaxy.
     * Uncertainty at a grand scale
       A test of Heisenberg's principle, on a scale visible to the naked eye, may aid the search for gravitational waves.
