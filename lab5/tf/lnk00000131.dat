     * Vitamin D doesn't disappoint
       Deleted Scenes
       Vitamin D seems to be living up to high expectations. A spate of 2013 studies has found that the vitamin may yield benefits in groups ranging from pregnant women to members of the military

       U.S. team breaks through subglacial lake
       Science & the Public | By Janet Raloff
       At 5 a.m. local time today (January 28), U.S. researchers successfully completed boring a 30-centimeter-diameter hole through 800 meters of Antarctic ice, piercing into Lake Whillans. It's
       one of a series of interconnected subglacial lakes that periodically fill and drain. Scientists estimate that the lake's water, which flows beneath the Whillans Ice Stream, has not had
       contact with the ... 01.28.13 | more >>

       Antarctic test of novel ice drill poised to begin
       Science & the Public | By Janet Raloff
       ROSS ICE SHELF, ANTARCTICA -- Any day now, a team of 40 scientists and support personnel expects to begin shoveling ice and snow into a melting bin. Over the next 24 to 36 hours, they'll
       send the resulting 90 degree Celsius water down through a clean hose that they'll unspool from above. They'll use the warm, high pressure jet to bore a 30-centimeter hole through 83 meters
       of ice. ... 12.15.12 | more >>

       This snowbird is really going SOUTH
       Science & the Public | By Janet Raloff
       Many people of a certain age (like my folks) enjoy flying south to warmer climes when winter weather threatens. I'm also flying south this December -- but not to warm up. As a guest of the
       National Science Foundation, I'll be checking out summer in the really deep South: Antarctica. Temps expected at certain sites I'm scheduled to visit, such as the South Pole, threaten to
       surpass the ... 12.06.12 | more >>

       Half of this hotel room looks like the inside of a Home Depot after the store has been lifted, shaken really hard, and set back down. The other half of the room, where a group of five
       middle-schoolers silently cluster, holds the results of their afternoon's work -- an elaborate, giant Rube Goldberg-style mousetrap. Strands of dominoes feature prominently in the design,
       of course, but so ... 10.01.12 | more >>

       Epidemic of skin lesions reported in reef fish
       Science & the Public | By Janet Raloff
       A British-Australian research team has just found coral trout living on the south side of the Great Barrier Reef sporting dark skin lesions. Fifteen percent of the affected populations at
       two sites bore brown-black growths, some of them raised and almost scablike. The authors conclude that they've stumbled onto an epidemic of melanoma -- a type of skin cancer -- in iconic

       I read with sadness this week that Weekly Reader is about to disappear.
       Earlier this year, Scholastic Classroom Magazines purchased the publication, one that had been an iconic source of news (throughout my elementary-school years, anyway). The buyer already
       had 28 subject-specific publications. It will now begin "combining the features of Weekly Reader into the Scholastic classroom magazines," says Cathy Lasiewicz, with Scholastic in New York
       City. "There ... 07.26.12 | more >>

       Blog: Remembering Sally Ride
       Deleted Scenes
       Though she didn't know it, I spent many evenings with Sally Ride in the 1980s. Ride, who in 1983 became the first American woman in space, died July 23 at age 61 after fighting pancreatic
       cancer for 17 months. But decades ago, she often sent me gently to sleep, inviting my young mind to follow her high into the microgravity skies above Earth.Many childhood evenings involved

       You know that a scientific idea has penetrated popular culture when people start making jokes about it. Like the one about the priest who changed his name to Higgs so he could be better at
       giving mass. Or some that say a gadget for negating the Higgs field would be a weapon of mass destruction. Most are variants on a Higgs boson walks into a bar ... finally.

     * FDA bans BPA in baby bottles, cups
       Science & the Public | By Janet Raloff
       From now on, U.S. manufacturers may no longer produce polycarbonate baby bottles and sippy cups (for toddlers) if the clear plastic had been manufactured from bisphenol A, a
       hormone-mimicking compound. Long-awaited, the announcement is anything but a bold gesture. The Obama administration decided to lock this barn door after the cow had died. 07.17.12 | more >>
     * Putting BPA-based dental fillings in perspective
       Science & the Public | By Janet Raloff
       A new study finds that children who have their cavities filled with a white composite resin known as bis-GMA appear to develop small but quantifiable drops in psychosocial function. To put
       it simply: Treated kids can become more moody, aggressive and generally less well adjusted. 07.16.12 | more >>

       DUBLIN -- Time and again in recent centuries, science has challenged humankind's conception of itself. Copernicus demoted humans from their central location in the cosmos. Darwin denied
       their inherent distinction from other animals. Computers now trounce human intellect, defeating the smartest people at chess and on Jeopardy! And lately modern neuroscience has pretty much
