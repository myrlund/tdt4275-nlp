     * Vitamin D doesn't disappoint
       Deleted Scenes
       Vitamin D seems to be living up to high expectations. A spate of 2013 studies has found that the vitamin may yield benefits in groups ranging from pregnant women to members of the military
       to kids in a dentist chair. 04.08.13 | more >>

       Young scientist crosses fingers for Mars rover

       On Sunday night, NASA will attempt to land its newest, biggest rover in a massive crater on Mars -- and if everything goes well, Ryan Anderson will get to find out whether he's right or
       wrong. 08.01.12 | more >>

       Blog: Remembering Sally Ride
       Deleted Scenes
       Though she didn't know it, I spent many evenings with Sally Ride in the 1980s. Ride, who in 1983 became the first American woman in space, died July 23 at age 61 after fighting pancreatic
       cancer for 17 months. But decades ago, she often sent me gently to sleep, inviting my young mind to follow her high into the microgravity skies above Earth.Many childhood evenings involved

     * Higgs hysteria
       Deleted Scenes
       You know that a scientific idea has penetrated popular culture when people start making jokes about it. Like the one about the priest who changed his name to Higgs so he could be better at
       giving mass. Or some that say a gadget for negating the Higgs field would be a weapon of mass destruction. Most are variants on a Higgs boson walks into a bar ... finally.

     * Blog: Arsenic-based life gets even more toxic
       Deleted Scenes
       The brouhaha over a 2010 report that a microbe can incorporate the toxic element arsenic in its cells continues -- though most experts consider the issue settled long ago. A study from
       Rosemary Redfield's lab at the University of British Columbia that replicated the original experiments and found no evidence that microbe GFAJ-1 was using arsenic to survive has now been
       published online in ... 07.09.12 | more >>
     * Essay: Nature's secrets foretold
       Deleted Scenes
       By now, all aficionados of physics news -- and quite a few people who don't know physics from phonics -- have heard about the discovery of the Higgs boson. It's the biggest news in physics
       ever tweeted. And it came after a long wait. For more than three decades, the Higgs has been physicists' version of King Arthur's Holy Grail, Ponce de Leon's Fountain of Youth, Captain
       Ahab's ... 07.04.12 | more >>

       CMS spokesman: 'We've observed a new particle'
       Deleted Scenes
       Updated 1 p.m. EDT July 3
       A video that was briefly made public on the CERN website July 3 confirms that the European physics lab has discovered a new particle -- most likely the long-sought Higgs boson.

     * Alien hunter redirects her search to Earth-based funding
       Deleted Scenes
       Imagine if E.T. phoned Earth and heard, "We're sorry, no one is here to take your call right now. Please try again later." Or if, after traveling for thousands of years, radio signals
       carrying the imprint of an alien technological civilization fell on dormant Earthly ears. 05.29.12 | more >>
     * Pacific coasts in line for solar eclipse
       Deleted Scenes
       Look at the shadows cast by tree leaves late Sunday afternoon, and they might look a little different than usual. The usual dappled pattern of light passing through holes in the leaves
       might look a bit more curvy, a bit more ringlike. 05.18.12 | more >>
     * California mad cow case no reason for panic
       Deleted Scenes
       When a dairy cow in California was recently diagnosed with a rare form of mad cow disease, agriculture officials said the animal posed no danger to human health. The assurances are more
       than just platitudes, scientists and a new study in mice suggests. 04.30.12 | more >>
     * A result of zero doesn't always mean zero results
       Deleted Scenes
       Forlorn graduate students sometimes turn to a publication called The Journal of Negative Results.* In graduate student mythology, it's the repository for toiled-over experiments that
       produced nothing -- no effects, no detections, no differences, nothing. 04.26.12 | more >>

       The Newtonian physics (or not) of Angry Birds Space

       The Angry Birds have arrived ... IN SPACE, still aimed toward exacting revenge on a cadre of bright green pigs who've waddled off with the birds' eggs. 04.05.12 | more >>

     * Higgs running out of hiding places
       Deleted Scenes
       Even as physicists in Europe close in on their most-wanted quarry -- a particle known as the Higgs boson -- scientists in Illinois are helping narrow the hunt. New measurements of a
       different particle, one called the W boson, confirm the Higgs is in the mass range that most physicists had thought. 02.23.12 | more >>

     * HiRISE clocks hurricane-speed winds on Mars
       Deleted Scenes
       Mars is not a placid place.
       Among other things, dust devils carving trails through the planet's reddish sands kick junk into its atmosphere. But though scientists have been able to estimate how quickly these devils
       travel across the rocky landscape, no one could really pinpoint the speed of the the swirling winds inside them until recently. Previous measurements of the extraterrestrial whirling
       dervishes' interiors ... 10.14.11 | more >>

       The Sopranos with feathers
       Deleted Scenes
       The day starts with chatting about the Black Death over bagels, then detours to garbage piles and ends with a goofy interview moment --one of the best days I've spent in a long time.

     * A fine how-do-you-do from an asteroid
       Deleted Scenes
       A shudder of air and a quick streak of light were the only signs of an asteroid's near-Earth flyby on June 27. Asteroid 2011 MD isn't this year's closest approach by a near-Earth object,
       nor is it the largest (a 400-meter-wide boulder is expected to pass within the moon's orbit in November). What got the Internet buzzing was that 2011 MD was discovered only five days before
       its flyby. 06.27.11 | more >>
     * No new particle from second detector
       Deleted Scenes
       In the search for a new elementary particle that would transmit a previously unknown force, it's been an 11-day roller coaster ride at Fermilab's Tevatron, the premiere U.S. atom smasher.
       And the ride's not over yet. 06.10.11 | more >>
     * Other shoe drops on arsenic-eating bugs
       Deleted Scenes
       It took no time in December for critics to cast doubt on the remarkable claim that a bacterium force-fed with arsenic incorporated some of the poison into its cells and even its DNA. As
       soon as the Science paper by Felisa Wolfe-Simon and colleagues was published, critics took to the airwaves and the blogosphere; there was even coverage of the coverage. 05.27.11 | more >>
     * Skeptical scientists call 1-800-BALONEY on cell phone study
       Deleted Scenes
       Because the reader letters we get here at Science News can be among the most provocative and insightful parts of the magazine, I make a point of checking out the correspondence pages of
       scientific journals for equally juicy material. In the Letters section of the May 25 Journal of the American Medical Association, I hit paydirt in the form of an electrifying debate over a
       paper published in ... 05.25.11 | more >>
     * Rumors of a Higgs discovery are just that
       Deleted Scenes
       A leaked internal document, rumors flying on blogs, and scientists in thrall. Not exactly the stuff one usually associates with experiments in elementary particle physics. But all the rules
       and academic niceties get thrown out the window when it's a potential sighting of the Higgs boson. 04.29.11 | more >>
