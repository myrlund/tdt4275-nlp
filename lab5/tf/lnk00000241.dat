       For 10 years, Taina Litwak's job was to draw almost nothing but mosquitoes. As a science illustrator in Washington, D.C., for the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Litwak helped
       document disease-transmitting species that might endanger soldiers overseas. T. Litwak Today, Litwak's work offers a bit more variety: She's an "art department of one" in D.C. for the U.S.
       Department of Agriculture's Systematic Entomology Laboratory. She helps scientists describe insects that threaten crops or forests, as well as bugs that could kill these pests. This means

       Wayne Madison used to have pet spiders as a kid. Now he has turned that into a life-long passion and career. Here's a look Madison and two other scientists who are lucky enough to spend
       their adult lives working in fields that first captivated them in childhood.Visit the new Science News for Kids website and read the full story: Studying what you love

       FOR KIDS: DNA hints at ancient cousins
       Home / News / FOR KIDS: DNA hints at ancient cousins
       In a new study, scientists have found hints that some previously unknown ancestors of modern humans appear to have split off into a separate species more than a million years ago. Later,
       some modern humans appear to have mated with this sister species. Traces of that that sister species persist today in the DNA of some African people. The new findings have appeared in a
       scientific journal. Visit the new Science News for Kids website and read the full story: DNA hints at ancient cousins

       FOR KIDS: Iron versus climate change
       Home / News / FOR KIDS: Iron versus climate change
       In 2004, a team of scientists traveled by ship to an enormous whirlpool in the ocean near Antarctica. Their goal was to find out if a risky strategy for fighting climate change might work.
       The plan: Dump iron in the water to trigger the growth of organisms called algae. Then let the algae soak up carbon dioxide, a gas that contributes to global warming. Finally, watch to see
       if the organisms drift to the seafloor. This iron fertilization of algae appears to have been successful, the researchers now report. Visit the new Science News for Kids website and read

       FOR KIDS: Tomatoes' tasteless green gene
       Home / News / FOR KIDS: Tomatoes' tasteless green gene
       The tomatoes your great-grandparents ate probably tasted little like the ones you eat today. The fruit used to have more flavor. A lot more flavor. In fact, tomatoes "were once so flavorful
       that you could take one in your hand and eat it straight away just like we regularly eat apples or peaches," according to plant scientist Alan Bennett. He belongs to a team of international
       scientists who now think they know one reason why the fruit has lost so much flavor. Visit the new Science News for Kids website and read the full story: Tomatoes' tasteless green gene

       FOR KIDS: Paralyzed rats walk again
       Home / News / FOR KIDS: Paralyzed rats walk again
       With the right treatment and training, paralyzed rats with damaged spinal cords could walk again, a new study shows. The animals even regained the ability to climb stairs and move around
       obstacles. Of course, rats aren't humans. But the new research suggests that people might benefit from treatments similar to those the rodents received. Visit the new Science News for

       Home / News / FOR KIDS: Cool Jobs: Wide world of robots
       When you think of robots, you might think of something like Wall-E -- a machine designed to perform boring tasks, such as compacting trash. But engineers today are making robots that can do
       much more interesting jobs. Robots shaped like snakes could one day search for victims after an earthquake or help doctors perform surgeries. Underwater robots might be able to lead fish
       away from environmental disasters. And humanlike robots could help people with diseases or physical disabilities. Visit the new Science News for Kids website and read the full story: Cool

       FOR KIDS: Caecilians: The other amphibian
       Home / News / FOR KIDS: Caecilians: The other amphibian
       Caecilians belong to the same group of animals that includes frogs and salamanders. But unlike other amphibians, caecilians lack legs. Some caecilians are as short as a pencil, while others
       grow as long as a child. Their eyes are tiny and hidden beneath skin and sometimes bone. And they have a pair of tentacles on their face that can sniff out chemicals in the environment.
       "The whole creature is really quite bizarre," says Emma Sherratt, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University. Visit the new Science News for Kids website and read the full

       Home / News / FOR KIDS: Weed wars
       When Stanley Culpepper was a kid, he spent hours pulling weeds on his family's farm. "We pulled and pulled and pulled," he says.  Culpepper loved working on the farm, but he didn't like
       weeding. He became a scientist to figure out easier ways for farmers to control weeds. "I decided there's got to be a better way than pulling weeds all your life," says Culpepper, now a
       weed scientist at the University of Georgia in Tifton. He and other scientists found chemicals can tackle many weeds. But increasingly, this chemical weed control is coming at a price
