     * Scientists name large but elusive lizard
       Though locals knew of it, the 2-meter cousin to Komodo dragons had escaped scientific description. (p. 8)
     * Colliding dust grains charge each other up
       Physicists propose a way that cloud particles can electrify themselves. (p. 9)
     * Famous Martian meteorite younger than thought
       The famous fragment of Mars, once proposed to hold signs of extraterrestrial life, is still pretty old. But the rock appears to have formed about 400 million years later than earlier
       analyses indicated. (p. 10)
     * Not your grandfather's space program
       President Obama offers a new plan that would send humans to orbit Mars during the mid-2030s. (p. 10)
     * Newfound neighbor to solar system is a cool slacker
       Researchers have found the closest brown dwarf to Earth and the coolest yet seen, raising the possibility that the nearest starlike body to the solar system may be a brown dwarf rather than
       a star. (p. 11)
     * Backward planets may have flipped into place
       Reversed orbits among `hot Jupiters' decreases chance of Earthlike neighbors. (p. 11)

     * Hobbit debate goes out on some limbs
       A new analysis of fossil hobbits' limb bones links them to much earlier hominids, and immediately attracts criticism. (p. 14)
     * Partial skeletons may represent new hominid
       Partial skeletons may represent a new hominid species with implications for Homo origins, one researcher claims. But many of his peers disagree. (p. 14)
     * For ancient hominids, thumbs up on precision grip
