     * People : Spreading a scientific way of life
       Home / Departments / People / May 4, 2013; Vol.183 #9 / People : Spreading a scientific way of life
       Give a man a fish and he'll have a seafood supper. Teach a man engineering principles and he could start an aquafarm, devise a better net or fishing pole or maybe even come up with an
       entirely new way to combat chronic fishlessness. That's the premise behind a nonprofit organization called Future Scientist that teaches people to use basic science and engineering to solve
       problems -- and then encourages them to teach others to do the same. The group is the brainchild of biological engineers Gautham Venugopalan (below, right) of the University of California,
       Berkeley and Richard Novak (bel... (p. 36)

       Harvard geneticist Joseph Pickrell is part of a new generation of scientists talking about their data not just over the lab bench, but in conversations online. Pickrell uses the Internet to
       open himself, his research and his thoughts about others' work to public scrutiny. Pickrell (pictured) analyzes genetic data from people living today to reconstruct ancient evolutionary
       relationships. But he wouldn't expect his research subjects to make their genetic secrets public if he wasn't willing to do so himself. "I feel pretty strongly that genetic data isn't
       scary," he says. To prove ... (p. 32)
