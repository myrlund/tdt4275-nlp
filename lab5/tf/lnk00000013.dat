     * Materials Science

     * News in Brief: Malaria drug made by baker's yeast
       Fermentation process using bioengineered version of the fungus could become important new production method for artemisinin.
     * News in Brief: Network of cell mimics comes to life
       3-D printed material resembles body tissue in form and perhaps function.
     * News in Brief: Highlights from the American Physical Society meeting
       Highlights from the March meeting, held in Baltimore on March 18-22, 2013, include how fire ants need a little water to dig deep, what makes trees scream and a tiny crystal that can squeeze
       through an even tinier tube.
     * Caffeine's buzz attracts bees to flowers
       Nectar of some blooms carries the drug, which improves bee memory.
     * News in Brief: Missing link in taste chain identified
       Taste-cell protein sends message to brain that tongue has detected sweet, bitter or umami flavor.
     * News In Brief: Lipstick smudges reveal their identity
       Raman spectroscopy allows forensics researchers to distinguish among dozens of lipsticks.
     * News in Brief: Synthetic nanomaterial can recognize viruses
       The new method may have advantages over antibody-based technologies.
     * News in Brief: Bitter and sour taste detectors also say, 'too salty'
       Mice that can't sense the two tastes find high sodium attractive.
     * Gold-digging microbe
       By spitting out a molecule, a bacterium draws solid gold out of solution.
     * Disorder at Work
       Proteins without a definite shape can still take on important jobs.
     * DNA stores poems, a photo and a speech
       The molecule swaps its biological role for a computational one, that of long-term data storage.
     * Trick of light makes microwave imaging simple
       Metamaterials and math combine to produce a quick, cheap system.
     * Hottest temperature ever measured is a negative one
       Ultracold gas sets record on the kelvin scale.
     * Repellent slime has material virtues
       Threads isolated from hagfishes' defensive goo demonstrate superior strength and flexibility.
     * Printed robot moves with a beat
       Tiny device created with a 3-D printer employs heart cells to make it move.
     * Tiny muscles pull a big punch
       Coated carbon nanotubes form the basis of this smart new material.
     * Hydrogen fuel edges a step closer
       A new chemical setup creates clean-burning gas by mimicking plant photosynthesis.
     * Plastic fantastic seals in speeding projectiles
       Layered nanomaterial shows how bulletproof polymers wrap around penetrating particles.
     * Human blood types have deep evolutionary roots
       The ABO system may date back 20 million years or more, a genetic analysis suggests.
     * Prospecting for Quasicrystals
       Siberian journey nets a mineralogical space oddity.
     * Depths hold clues to dearth of xenon in air
       The gas doesn't dissolve well in minerals deep inside Earth, a discovery that may explain why it's also scarce in the atmosphere.
     * Research in cell communication system wins 2012 chemistry Nobel
       G protein-coupled receptors relay messages from other cells and the environment into the cell's interior.
     * Cancer cells executed by magnet
       Metal nanoparticles trigger cell's own death machinery.
     * Chemical bond shields extreme microbes from poison
       Molecular structure explains how `arsenic life' bacteria instead survive by fishing out phosphate from their surroundings.
     * News in Brief: Japanese lab lays claim to element 113
       With the latest observation of a superheavy atom, a chemical catfight looms over who will get to name it.
     * Degradable devices vanish after use
       Technique combines silicon, magnesium and silk for medical implants, transistors and digital cameras that can melt away.
     * Water boils sans bubbles
       Insulating steam keeps a superhot object from splattering the soup.
     * Too-young caterpillars like scent of sex
       Larvae respond to mate-attracting pheromones, raising evolutionary questions about what a very grown-up chemical signal could mean to them.
     * Big jobs go to loyal proteins
       Cells offload much of their nonessential work on enzymes that juggle a number of tasks.
     * Unmixing oil and water
