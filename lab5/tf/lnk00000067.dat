     * New star dating method
       Science Past
       The first effective technique for measuring the ages of large numbers of stars like the sun has been developed. Providing a powerful research tool for astronomers, the new dating technique
       is based on relatively simple measurements of a single chemical element, lithium. The age calculations can be applied to both young and "ordinary" stars, as well as to the sun itself. The
       new method ... 04.18.13 | more >>

       Faux pas on fashion In "Students honored for research," (SN: 4/6/13, p. 28), the female winner got singled out as "decked out in a lavender satin dress." Didn't Hillary Clinton recently
       point out to an interviewer that he asked her about her clothes, whereas he wouldn't ask a man that? What are you trying to convey? Irena Swanson, Portland, Ore. 04.18.13 | more >>

     * Transplant from the dead
       Science Past
       The surgeon's dream of transplanting organs from the dead to the living seems closer to reality. A man aged 54 died at Leeds (England) General Infirmary. One of his kidneys was removed
       quickly and placed in a 37-year-old man gravely ill because his kidneys had failed. Four months later the borrowed kidney was still functioning and the doctors were somewhat elated. For the
       donor and the ... 04.04.13 | more >>

       Pacing Alzheimer's Science Stats "Alzheimer's Advancing" (SN: 3/9/13, p. 4) reports a new analysis extrapolating from 2010 U.S. Census data that concludes Alzheimer's disease will triple by
       2050. Omitted in such an analysis is the accelerating advance of science and medicine over the next 40 years. The gloomy prediction makes little sense unless science stops short while the

       Get a grip The article "Pruney fingers get better grip" (SN: 2/9/13, p. 11) indicated that skin wrinkling in response to extended exposure to water was the result of constricting blood
       vessels. I was waiting to read about the possibility that this was the body's response to prevent heat loss. Water has a high heat capacity, and therefore I might expect that blood vessel
       constriction is ... 03.20.13 | more >>

     * Vehicle on moon may sink into fluffy stuff
       Science Past
       The surface of the moon may be covered with deep layers of fluffy material into which landing vehicles could sink out of sight.... Research so far has shown that loose particles hit by
       meteoroids settle down into the moon's rock or mineral surface. This surface becomes exposed to radiation and breaks down into fine particles of dust. The dust coagulates into larger and
       larger clumps.... ... 03.07.13 | more >>

       Baseball's resident physicist
       People
       Picture sitting at a baseball park, leisurely watching a game. Your mind wanders, torn between a box of Cracker Jack and the conversation drifting down from the row behind you. Suddenly the
       crack of a bat snaps you to attention, and you scan the field for the ball. Physicist Alan Nathan would say your attention is piqued because well-hit balls make a different noise than weak
       pop-ups do. 03.07.13 | more >>

       Grand Canyon rising If the geology of the Grand Canyon dates back to 70 million years ago "Grand Canyon's age pushed back," (SN: 1/12/13, p. 15), that would be around the same time the
       Rocky Mountains were being pushed up by the subduction process originating off the western continental coast. Could the lifting of the Colorado Plateau be related to the lifting of the
       Colorado Rockies? ... 03.07.13 | more >>
