       As Told By the Egg
       Home / Features / September 8, 2012; Vol.182 #5 / As Told By the Egg
       Whether the chicken or the egg came first doesn't occupy biologist Luca Jovine's thoughts too much. Animals have been laying eggs for millions of years, after all. Over time, evolution has
       reshaped both the eggs and the creatures hatched from them. Instead, Jovine spends his time unscrambling another egg-related conundrum: How does the egg orchestrate the molecular mating
       dance that creates all these new individuals? For a fuller understanding of the ways that egg and sperm tango during the lead-up to fertilization, Jovine is seeking help from the chicken.
       Eggs come in all shapes and si... (p. 16)

       It turns out that the dreamlike state that patients experience during surgery isn't really sleep -- at least not the kind you do every night. Patients going into surgery are given a mixture
       of medicines called general anesthetics to keep them from feeling any pain. The medicines numb the entire body, including the brain. One of medicine's greatest mysteries is how the drugs
       work together in the brain to create a pain-free state. Visit the new Science News for Kids website and read the full story: No ordinary zzz's

       Defying Depth
       Home / Features / June 16, 2012; Vol.181 #12 / Defying Depth
       When you think about life's pressures weighing down on you, consider the plight of Palaemonetes varians -- the Atlantic ditch shrimp. Smaller than a finger, and covered with only a thin
       shell, the translucent creature flourishes in the warm, shallow waters off the coast of northern Europe. Recently, though, scientists at the University of Southampton in England have
       plucked dozens of the critters from their homes and carried them to the lab, placing them in reinforced containers that replicate the crushing pressures found more than three kilometers
       beneath the sea's surface. Here, where ... (p. 26)

       Furry Friends Forever
       Home / Features / April 7, 2012; Vol.181 #7 / Furry Friends Forever
       A good friend will make you laugh, defend you in an argument, cheer you on when you're doing well and cheer you up when you're feeling sad. Best buds can be good for your health, too.
       Maintaining close relationships means less stress and a longer life. And you don't even have to be human. Just as with people, animals of other sorts can benefit from having a BFF. New
       studies show that animals with someone they can count on -- to get them out of a scrape, share food or deliver a kind gesture -- are more likely to reproduce and are better at fighting
       disease. Such findings suggest that... (p. 18)

       Jars of Plenty
       Home / Features / December 17, 2011; Vol.180 #13 / Jars of Plenty
       Wine flowed freely from ancient Greece during its golden age, but new work suggests nuts and various herbs were also in demand. With the help of DNA analysis, scientists are getting a
       present-day look at centuries-old trade in the Mediterranean. Such studies may help debunk some long-held assumptions, namely that the bulk of Greek commerce revolved around wine. During
       the fifth through third centuries B.C., the Mediterranean and Black seas were major thoroughfares for ships loaded with thousands of curvaceous jars known as amphorae, thought from their
       shape to contain a drink made from ferme... (p. 26)

       A Spitting Image of Health
       Home / Features / November 19, 2011; Vol.180 #11 / A Spitting Image of Health
       Rinse and spit. Someday soon, doctors may join dentists in issuing these simple instructions. And before leaving the office, you might know whether you're at risk for oral cancer.
       Additional tests on that same ptui may reveal whether you show signs of certain other cancers or diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. Saliva -- the frothy fluid that helps clean the
       mouth, digest food and fight tooth decay -- carries many of the same proteins and other molecules found in blood and urine. Scientists have long been interested in mining a person's mix of
       these compounds for clues to diag... (p. 26)

       Singled Out
       Home / Features / October 8, 2011; Vol.180 #8 / Singled Out
       Fly over any baseball stadium when the home-team batter slams a double in the gap with two men on base, and you'll see a crowd of fans rising in unison, arms waving wildly in the air. You'd
       think you were viewing typical baseball fan behavior. Witness this scene at ground level, though, and you'll get a different picture. While a majority of fans participate in the cheering,
       others are sipping beer, attending to scorecards or roaming the walkways in search of a hot dog. Such displays of individuality shouldn't come as a surprise -- people often react
       differently to the same circumst... (p. 26)
