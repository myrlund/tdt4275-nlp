   Bruce Bower Bruce Bower has written about the behavioral sciences for Science News since 1984. He often writes about psychology, anthropology, archaeology and mental health issues. Bruce has a
   master's degree in psychology from Pepperdine University and a master's degree in journalism from the University of Missouri. Following an internship at Science News in 1981, he worked as a

   Bruce a Science Writer Fellow, with a grant to visit psychological scientists of his own choosing. Early stints as an aide in a day school for children and teenagers with severe psychological
   problems and as a counselor in a drug diversion center provided Bruce with a surprisingly good background for a career in science journalism.

   in zoology. After two years of managing aquatic systems for the laboratories at the National Institutes of Health, she went back to school for a master's in science writing. She graduated from
   Johns Hopkins University in 2011, and joined the Science News staff a few months later. On the weekends, though, she still prefers to spend her time in the woods as a volunteer at the Jug Bay
