     * Building Beauty
       Deconstructing flowers yields the secrets of petals, scents and hue (p. 22)
     * Planck by Planck
       The launch of the European Space Agency's Planck mission, set for late April or early May, will put into orbit a new tool --the microwave equivalent of polarized sunglasses -- that may
       offer a view of the dawn of time. (p. 16)
     * Urban heat
       Cities sizzle as more people move in (p. 26)
     * Dissing a loaded label for some unicellular life
       Prominent biologist calls `prokaryote' outdated term. (p. 5)
     * Public tantrums defeat monkey moms too
       Rhesus macaque moms are more likely to give in to screaming babies when bystanders are watching and reacting (p. 8)
     * Goo gives eels just the right buoyancy
       Scientists survey the specific gravity of 25 marine critters. (p. 8)
     * Pushing back an oxygen-rich atmosphere
       Hematite crystals in Australian rocks hint that Earth's atmosphere was oxygenated earlier than previously thought. (p. 9)
     * Seeing the future hot spells
       Satellite data could help scientists better predict killer heat waves, such as the one that hit Europe in 2003. (p. 9)
     * Plants reveal pollen-luring secrets
       Scientists finally pin down the proteins one plant uses to lure pollen tubes to its plant ovaries. (p. 10)
     * Light could heal materials
       Scientists have created a new material that repairs itself when exposed to ultraviolet light. (p. 10)
     * Gradual treatment of peanut allergies shows promise
       A slow and incremental introduction of peanuts into the diet helps some children overcome an allergy to the food, but it takes time and close supervision. (p. 11)
     * MicroRNAs provide telltale signature of organ rejection
       Levels of microRNAs in the blood and tissue distinguish rejected transplants from healthy tissue. (p. 11)
     * Vaccine could protect against virus that causes birth defects
       An experimental vaccine against cytomegalovirus has the ability to prevent infection half the time it's administered, suggesting the vaccine might prevent birth defects the virus can cause.
       (p. 11)
     * How deep brain stimulation works for Parkinson's
       New studies in rodents show that methods that are less invasive than deep brain stimulation may help people with Parkinson's disease regain movement. (p. 11)
     * Brines on Mars
       Unusually high concentration of perchlorate salts found in Martian soil suggests that the Red Planet may harbor shallow, extremely briny oceans just below its surface. The existence of
       these brines may explain a host of puzzles on Mars. (p. 12)
     * Hotter than the sun
       Researchers for the first time directly observe Alfvén waves. (p. 12)
     * Evidence mounts for an exotic supersolid
       Rubidium atoms simultaneously act like a solid and a superfluid. (p. 13)
     * Feelings, universal musical feelings
       Africans who spurn all things Western provide evidence that people everywhere recognize expressions of happiness, sadness and fear in music. Listen to some of the audio samples the study
       used. (p. 14)
     * Peking Man fossils show their age
       Scientists have pushed back the age of Peking Man, raising questions about whether Homo erectus trekked to eastern Asia in two separate migrations. (p. 14)
