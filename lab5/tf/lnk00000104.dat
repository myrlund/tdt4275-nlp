   For decades, astronomers have grappled with their inability to decipher the universe's darkest secret: the identity of most of its matter.

   It's not the same stuff as the ordinary atomic variety of matter common on Earth. Atoms or their parts -- such as protons and neutrons -- make up less than 17 percent of the mass in the cosmos.
   All the rest is "dark" -- invisible to eyes and telescopes, its presence deduced by its gravitational tug on stars and galaxies (SN: 8/28/10, p. 22). This mystery matter apparently consists of
   tiny particles of some exotic species, but efforts to trap them (in underground detectors) or make them (in particle accelerators) have produced frustrating results: Some experiments find hints
   of such particles; others find nothing.

   Yet despite the frustration, physicists offer a message of hope. With a deluge of new data already in hand, and more precise probes in the works, learning the identity of dark matter may just
   be a matter of time.

   "My feeling," says theoretical physicist Katherine Freese, "is that we're on the edge of discovering it."

   By discovering it, she means directly detecting the existence of dark matter particles, determining their species and mass and then, ideally, figuring out how they fit into physicists' broader
   theories of matter and energy. And as it turns out, the latest twists in the dark matter plot suggest that those particles might not fit where most experts had expected.

   Two problems, one particle

   Dark matter does have to fit in somehow, though. While its existence has been established only indirectly, few experts now doubt its presence throughout the cosmos. It was first inferred 80
   years ago, when Caltech astronomer Fritz Zwicky noticed that clusters of galaxies behave oddly -- the speeds of galaxies moving within a cluster cannot be explained by the gravity of the
   visible mass.

   Later, astronomers found that the outer edges of most galaxies rotate much more rapidly than they ought to, if galaxies contain only visible matter. Extra unseen matter was needed to explain
   those observations, unless the law of gravity had somehow been repealed for long distances (a prospect seriously entertained by some researchers but dismissed by most experts). Further
   compelling evidence for dark matter came in 2006, when observations of colliding galaxies showed that ordinary matter did not track with the gravity of the collision debris.

   As recently as a couple of decades ago, many astronomers suspected that dark matter might be ordinary matter clumped into lightless spheres -- massive compact objects whimsically dubbed MACHOs.
   Such balls of darkness might be "failed stars" known as brown dwarfs, or possibly black holes. But various studies showed that MACHOs couldn't provide enough mass to explain the galactic spin
   rates. More likely, each galaxy is embedded in a cloud of massive subatomic particles, invisible because they don't interact with light.

   For that matter, they don't interact with much of anything -- hence their designation as weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs. If they exist, billions of these particles pass through
   you every second, but only about one per minute makes an impact on even a single atom in your body.

   Enthusiasm for WIMPs as dark matter candidates was bolstered by theorists' attempts to unite matter, gravity and other forces in a single mathematical package. Those physicists proposed that
   each fundamental particle of matter, and each basic force-carrying particle, had a "superparticle" cousin. Such particles would be more massive than their ordinary partners, perhaps just the
   right mass to explain the dark matter in space.

   Here was one of science's favorite coincidences: a possible solution for one mystery also offering an explanation for another great mystery. With two independent excuses for believing in WIMPs,
   scientists and funding agencies deemed it worthwhile to conduct experiments to search for them.

   One such search strategy was proposed in the 1980s by Freese and collaborators Andrzej Drukier and David Spergel. If galaxies lived in a massive cloud (known as a halo) of WIMPs, each star
   within a galaxy (and each planet) would constantly smash into those WIMPs as the galaxy rotated. The sun, for instance, travels along a spiral arm of the Milky Way toward the constellation
   Cygnus, plowing through the swarm of WIMPs in its path the way a car windshield splatters mosquitoes.

   Despite the reluctance of WIMPs to interact with ordinary matter, some few would, thus making it possible to record their presence with sensitive detectors. But windshields splatter more than
   mosquitoes. All sorts of gnats and moths and other bugs get flattened as well, their identities undecipherable from the smudges on the glass. In the same way, other subatomic particles, such as
   those produced by natural radioactivity, could fool the WIMP detectors. Freese and colleagues realized, though, that those other collisions occur at random. Collisions with WIMPs would be at a
   peak in June, as the Earth moved in the same direction as the sun toward Cygnus, but at a minimum in December, when the Earth was revolving around the sun in the opposite direction. (Fewer
   mosquitoes hit your windshield when you're backing up than when you're driving forward.)

   Sure enough, when an experiment named DAMA, buried deep under an Italian mountain, looked for signs of such collisions, it found more in the summer than winter. But that finding was met with
   skepticism when other experiments failed to confirm it. More recently, an experiment called CoGeNT, in a Minnesota mine, did find hints of a summer-winter difference (SN: 6/4/11, p. 10). But
   another detector (CDMS II), operating in the same Minnesota mine, has found no sign of WIMPs. And yet another experiment in the Italian lab (XENON100) also sees nothing. Analysis of 13 months
   of data "has yielded no evidence for dark matter interactions," the XENON100 team recently reported in Physical Review Letters.

   Dark reconciliation

   Despite the apparent inconsistencies among current experiments, Freese, of the University of Michigan, believes evidence for WIMPs will emerge in the next few years.

   "There are anomalous results, and they obviously can't all be right. But I'm predicting that one of the anomalies is right and we'll know pretty soon," she said at a recent symposium in
   Raleigh, N.C., sponsored by the Council for the Advancement of Science Writing.

   At first glance, the experiments seem hard to reconcile: Those finding nothing seem to suggest that the searches reporting signs of WIMPs must be wrong. But upon further review, the evidence
   against WIMPs is not indisputable. For one thing, Freese points out, each experiment uses a different material to detect the WIMPs, so comparisons can be tricky. And other theoretical issues
   come into play when comparing one experiment with another, Freese says, such as whether the likelihood of a WIMP collision depends on the spin of the atomic nucleus it collides with.

   Besides all that, current experiments are pushing the limit of their sensitivity. That's turning out to be an especially crucial problem -- made worse by the realization that WIMPs might not
   possess the amount of mass that the detectors were designed to look for.

   In 1998 the first supposed WIMP sighting, by the DAMA experiment, suggested a WIMP weighing in at about 60 proton masses, based on collisions recorded with iodine atoms in the detector's sodium
   iodide crystals. When other experiments found no sign of WIMPs, many physicists dismissed the DAMA results. But further data collected by the more advanced DAMA/LIBRA experiment continue to
   show the June-December difference -- and with a new twist: Analyzing collisions with sodium rather than iodine suggests a much lighter WIMP, perhaps of only five to 10 proton masses.

   That's not what scientists had expected. Although once considered a possibility, such low masses had supposedly been ruled out by particle accelerator searches.

   "The idea that this region is back is really a surprise," Freese says. "The experiments were really designed for the higher-mass region, not this low-mass region."

   With the realization that WIMPs might have relatively low masses, it may be possible to reconcile the incompatibilities among current WIMP-hunting detectors. "It has become clear that the
   breadth of possibilities for light WIMPs is much larger than previously appreciated," theorist Dan Hooper of Fermilab and colleagues write in a recent paper. But low-mass WIMPs live on the
   fringe of what current experiments were designed to find. Establishing the existence of dark matter WIMPs for sure will require more sensitive detectors, or novel detector strategies.

   One experiment expected to provide more sensitivity than previous searches will use a combination of liquid and gaseous xenon in a detector called LUX. It is scheduled to begin collecting data
   in 2013 at a depth of 1.5 kilometers in the Sanford Underground Research Facility (formerly the Homestake Mine) in South Dakota. Another promising approach is now being tested at the South Pole
   by a collaboration known as DM-Ice. It would use sodium iodide crystals, the same material used in the Italian DAMA/LIBRA experiment. Placing the detector more than 2 kilometers deep in
   Antarctic ice would shield it from most of the impostor particles. And because it is in the Southern Hemisphere, the peak WIMP rate would be expected in winter rather than summer, a check on
   whether it is the season, rather than the Earth's direction of travel, that accounts for the Italian results.

   Still, just counting more hits than expected isn't proof that the colliding particles arrive from the direction of Cygnus. A WIMP striking an atomic nucleus sends it recoiling in the opposite
   direction of the WIMP's arrival path. But current detectors measure WIMP impact by recording signals such as flashes of light or a slight increase in temperature, obtaining no information about
   direction.

   With a little help from biology, though, a future detector might be able to track the path of the recoiling nucleus. Freese and collaborators, including Harvard geneticist George Church,
   recently proposed a detector using single strands of the genetic molecule DNA hanging from a gold target. If the strands of DNA are strategically positioned, they will be sliced by a gold
   nucleus as it flies away after a WIMP impact (SN: 12/1/12, p. 9). If the order of the DNA building blocks (abbreviated A, T, C and G) is known, the pieces can be put back together to determine
   the path of the recoiling nucleus, kind of like reassembling the pages of a book that had been cut at a specific angle by scissors.

   SUSY steps aside

   If these new experiments establish low-mass WIMPs as the dark matter, scientists will no doubt celebrate the confirmation that WIMPs exist. But they will probably want to invite Alanis
   Morissette to the ceremony to sing "isn't it ironic." For if WIMPs turn out to have a low mass, one of the main motivations for seeking them so enthusiastically in the first place will have
   been a mirage.

   All along, most experts assumed that WIMPs would be the superpartner of an ordinary particle, as described by a theoretical framework known as supersymmetry (affectionately called SUSY for
   short). When accelerator experiments failed to find low-mass superpartners, dark matter hunters jumped to the conclusion that WIMPs must have higher masses. But WIMPs do not have to be
   superpartners. Any particle that interacts weakly with ordinary matter would do.

   Designing experiments to search for superpartner WIMPs may have led physicists astray, and may explain why the current results are so confusing. New detectors, designed without the constraint
   of faith in SUSY, may have better luck pursuing more speculative possibilities.

   "You remove one restriction from your theory," Freese says, "and a whole new world opens up."

   It wouldn't be the first time that scientists have let their theories mislead the interpretation of observations. Ancient astronomers didn't realize that the rotation of stars around the sky at
   night was observational evidence of the Earth's spin -- the reigning theory held that the Earth was motionless. Albert Michelson thought his experiment to detect the ether had failed -- the
   prevailing theory that light required an ethereal medium blinded him to his discovery that the ether didn't exist.

   Theory is nevertheless important, of course, in guiding the design of experiments and in interpreting their results. But, as Darwin's friend Thomas Henry Huxley once pointed out, sometimes a
   beautiful theory is slain by an ugly experimental fact. It's the law of the scientific jungle. So someday soon, scientists may have to sacrifice the beauty of SUSY to the cause of identifying
   the dark matter. Whatever the bulk of cosmic mass is made of, sooner or later earthbound scientists are going to figure it out.

     * Something seems very wrong with the concept of a large number of particles in a cloud surrounding galaxies. It seems to be begging for a "better theory".

     * I'm not a theoretical physicist, but it seems to me the reason we are having such difficulty 'seeing' WIMPS is because we CAN'T. I mean literally, it's not possible for us to
       see/detect/quantify them because we lack the structure to do so.
       Think of it in terms of this. How could A squared measure or quantify anything within the third dimension? It's not possible. For those items that passed through his flat land, would just
       be his items. Yet at the same time, the third dimension would continually influence the elements of his universe.
       So perhaps - instead of some particle - what we are seeing is the influence of the fourth dimensional universe on our third. We can't quantify or capture it, because it's not part of this
       universe. What we can capture - just looks like the stuff we already see. Yet it influences our dimension, just like our three dimensional universe influences' A Squared's.

     * I got a theory that the -399 kelvin of intersteller space acts like a force all it's own and compresses or pushes on galaxies and thats what holds them together, and the distinctive round
       shape of most of them are from that pressure being exerted from all sides. It's my bubble theory, like a bubble in water. Does away with dark matter-what do ya think?

       Every experiment looking for particle dark matter over the last 40 years has come up resoundingly negative.
       How many times does nature have to say "No!" before theoretical physicists realize that they are on a fool's errand?
       What will it take for them to give the dark matter candidacy of primordial black holes its first sustained and unbiased consideration?

     * I was wondering why in all discussions about dark matter and dark energy nobody suggested that they might be the remnants of the early universe before the Big Bang! An infinite universe in
       space and time would support that theory. It is hard to believe that the early universe was an absolute vacuum and since the matter cannot be created nor destroyed it must've existed before
       the Big Bang. As it has been stated that we can observe only about 20% of the matter/energy in our present universe would not make some sense to consider that the rest of it is what is left
       over from the BBB (before Big Bang) time? Just a hypothesis...

     * The experiments of Hot & Dense = Cold & Thin should contribute something useful. This would be a phase change instead of big bang. One wonders if the red shift is actually something else
       beside distance, it could be a remnant of a previous phase change. Means quasars were born 1.9 to 3 bya in a phase change.

     * Can you clarify what may be a contradiction? You say "atoms or their parts...make up 17% of the mass of the universe, dark matter the rest..." According to articles on the Higgs Boson
       (Science: 21Dec2012), atoms make up 4% of all matter/energy in the universe, dark matter 23% and dark energy the rest.
