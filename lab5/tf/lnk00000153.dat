       My Beloved Brontosaurus: On the Road with Old Bones, New Science, and Our Favorite Dinosaurs by Brian Switek
       Poor Brontosaurus. First named in 1879 when a paleontologist mistook an Apatosaurus skeleton for a new type of long-necked sauropod, Brontosaurus may be the most well-known dinosaur that
       never existed. Though the error was corrected in scientific circles as early as 1903, the iconic behemoth lingered in museums, movies and the public imagination for decades.

       Blindspot: Hidden Biases of Good People by Mahzarin Banaji and Anthony Greenwald
       In the 1970s, most classical musicians were men. Nobody thought much of it until some orchestras started concealing applicants' gender. As such blind auditions became more common over the
       next 20 years, the proportion of women hired into major symphony orchestras doubled from 20 percent to 40 percent. 04.18.13 | more >>

       Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder by Nassim Nicholas Taleb
       Just as a campfire feeds off random wind gusts, well-prepared people and organizations can benefit from volatility and chance events, risk researcher and former derivatives trader Taleb
       argues. But more often, he says, modern institutions handle unexpected jolts -- say, the recent financial crisis -- about as well as a candle flame resists a windstorm. 04.04.13 | more >>

       The Theoretical Minimum: What You Need to Know to Start Doing Physics by Leonard Susskind and George Hrabovsky
       Most popular books on physics attempt to explain ideas without equations (the popular dogma says that each equation cuts sales in half). But when the book's advertised purpose is to provide
       the (minimum) knowledge needed to actually do physics, equations are a must. And this book is full of them. 04.04.13 | more >>

       The Kingdom of Rarities by Eric Dinerstein
       Armchair naturalists will delight in following Dinerstein as he treks the globe to find uncommon species and figure out why they are rare. Through field investigations and other research,
       this conservation biologist with the World Wildlife Fund comes to a rather startling conclusion: The majority of Earth's nonmicroscopic species are rare -- and probably always have been.

       Louis Agassiz: Creator of American Science by Christoph Irmscher
       Swiss-born Louis Agassiz was the most famous naturalist in America in the mid-19th century. When he died in 1873, people across the United States mourned the loss of their favorite
       scientist. 03.20.13 | more >>

       Visions of Infinity: The Great Mathematical Problems by Ian Stewart
       The four-color map problem can be understood by a bright fourth-grader (the question: whether four colors are enough to ensure that no two countries with a common border share a color). By
       junior high, most kids can grasp prime numbers and learn something about their properties and patterns. High school algebra students can comprehend what Fermat's last theorem means. Yet
       these topics have ... 03.07.13 | more >>

       The Lady and Her Monsters: A Tale of Dissections, Real-Life Dr. Frankensteins, and the Creation of Mary Shelley's Masterpiece by Roseanne Montillo
       If the makers of Downton Abbey want to capitalize on the popularity of costume dramas, they might look for their next Lady Mary in Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein. Shelley's life
       needs no embellishment, complete with preposterous plots and love triangles set in an era of intense scientific curiosity about the human body. In this biography, Montillo explores how the

       Fabricated: The New World of 3D Printing by Hod Lipson and Melba Kurman
       The first chapter of Fabricated is set a few decades in the future: In your kitchen a 3-D printer outfitted with food cartridges cooks up breakfast, while across the street a giant printing
       nozzle oozes out the concrete foundation of a new home. At work, you're investigating the bioprinting black market, wherein counterfeiters sell sloppily printed organs for transplants. The

       The Visioneers: How a Group of Elite Scientists Pursued Space Colonies, Nanotechnologies, and a Limitless Future by W. Patrick McCray
       In the wake of the Manhattan Project and the Apollo program, almost anything seemed possible. And some scientists of the late 20th century went beyond the fanciful notions of futurists and
       science fiction writers to seriously explore where technology might take humans, society and culture. 02.21.13 | more >>

       Nature Wars: The Incredible Story of How Wildlife Comebacks Turned Backyards into Battlegrounds by Jim Sterba
       There's a war on in America's neighborhoods. In the past few decades, a confluence of three trends has brought man and beast into increasing conflict: the rebound of wildlife populations
       from near-historic lows, human populations' growing sprawl and the regrowth of forests on abandoned farmlands, especially in the Northeast. 02.07.13 | more >>

       The World Until Yesterday: What Can We Learn from Traditional Societies? by Jared Diamond
       While traditional peoples linger at the outskirts of modern society as curious exceptions, Jared Diamond makes a case that they also offer a glimpse of our ancient selves. Their way of life
       stands in contrast with modern lifestyles, which changed for most humans only "yesterday" in evolutionary terms. 01.24.13 | more >>

       The Universe Within: From Quantum to Cosmos (CBC Massey Lecture) by Neil Turok
       There's no shortage of smart, literate physicists -- think Lisa Randall, Steven Weinberg or Brian Greene -- whose popular writings bring the universe into sharp focus. But Neil Turok,
       director of Canada's Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, also brings humanity into the mix of cosmic questions. 01.10.13 | more >>

       Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data by Charles Wheelan
       Despite a reputation for being worse than damned lies, statistics conquered its enemies during the 20th century and now reigns over science. What happens in a scientific experiment is
       considered unworthy of serious consideration (that is, you can't get it published) unless formulas determine that the result is "statistically significant." 01.10.13 | more >>

       Hallucinations by Oliver Sacks
       Just before a migraine, New York Times blogger Siri Hustvedt had an amiable encounter with a tiny pink man and an equally tiny pink ox. The odd pair wandered around her bedroom a bit before
       vanishing. "I have often wished they would return," she writes, "but they never have." 12.27.12 | more >>

       Mirror Earth: The Search for Our Planet's Twin by Michael D. Lemonick
       According to one popular notion, everyone has a twin somewhere. Who knows, maybe the same is true for planets. Maybe there's even a doppelgänger Earth orbiting at just the right distance
       from a sunlike star to support life. In his latest book, science writer Lemonick provides a behind-the-scenes look at the decades-long search for just such a planet. The endeavor, long

       How Ancient Europeans Saw the World by Peter S. Wells
       Human vision is a curious sense, providing the brain with information about the external world, but not interpreting it. Vision provides only raw data; the brain's innate Photoshop software
       constructs a visual reality that depends on how the brain has learned to comprehend what it sees. In other words, thinking and seeing are not separate. So when Wells writes about how
       ancient Europeans ... 11.16.12 | more >>

       The Wisdom of Psychopaths: What Saints, Spies, and Serial Killers Can Teach Us About Success by Kevin Dutton
       "My father was a psychopath," Dutton admits in his introduction. Never violent, Dutton's dad was charming, ruthless and fearless. He wasn't Hannibal Lecter, just a very good salesman.

       Air: The Restless Shaper of the World by William Bryant Logan
       It's what we breathe. On the move, it brings wind and weather. As it vibrates, it communicates sound. It's hard to imagine a facet of life in which air is not a prime player. That's Logan's
       thesis, and he has constructed a veritable symphony of variations on it. 11.02.12 | more >>

       Dreamland: Adventures in the Strange Science of Sleep by David K. Randall
       In 1994, an earthquake knocked out electricity in Los Angeles, delivering previously unknown darkness to many residents. Some were alarmed by a silvery light in the black sky. Until then,
       apparently, the only Milky Way they had ever seen was a candy bar. But perhaps they got some good shut-eye that night. 11.02.12 | more >>

       The Joy of x: A Guided Tour of Math, from One to Infinity by Steven Strogatz
       The world would be a better place, it is safe to say, if everybody had a basic understanding of mathematics and an appreciation for its scope and power. Economics, science and medicine,
       energy and the environment and diverse realms of public policy all depend on math as a guide to factual accuracy, sound judgment and intelligent opinion. 10.19.12 | more >>

       Homo Mysterious: Evolutionary Puzzles of Human Nature by David P. Barash
       Through an evolutionary lens, this book explores proposals -- probable and improbable -- that seek to explain the mysteries of human biology and behavior. Looking at questions such as what
       adaptive advantages, if any, human ancestors might have gotten out of developing the mental capacities for art, Barash provides no pat answers. Instead, he delights in all that remains
       unknown and unexplained. 10.19.12 | more >>

       to people. And human behavior, explosively populating the planet and pushing into remote landscapes, is speeding the arrival of the next outbreak. Serious stuff, but writer Quammen mixes

       surface of the moon. 09.21.12 | more >>
