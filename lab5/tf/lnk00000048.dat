       Perfect liquids suggest theory's math mirrors something real (p. 26)
     * Heavyweight galaxies in the young universe
       New observations of full-grown galaxies in the young universe may force astrophysicists to revise their leading theory of galaxy formation, at least as it applies to regions where galaxies
       congregate into clusters. (p. 5)
     * Autism immerses 2-year-olds in a synchronized world
       By age 2, kids with autism focus on synchronized physical events, such as a person's moving lips accompanied by sounds, rather than on eye movements and other social cues, a new study
       suggests. (p. 8)
     * Hobbit brain small, but organized for complex intelligence
       Evolution may have endowed a controversial species with small but humanlike brains equipped to support advanced thinking (p. 9)
     * Chimps ambidextrous when digging wells
       A survey of water-collection holes dug on the banks of an African river by wild chimpanzees indicates that, unlike people, these apes don't have a preference for using either the right or
       left hand on manual tasks. (p. 9)
     * Male circumcision fends off the most common STDs
       Male circumcision prevents some genital herpes and human papillomavirus infections, a study in Ugandan adolescent boys and men shows. (p. 10)

     * Parasites hinder immunity against cholera
       Harboring intestinal parasites seems to limit a person's ability to fend off cholera, a new study conducted in Bangladesh shows. (p. 11)
     * Prions are common, at least in yeast
       A new study of shape-shifting proteins in baker's yeast reveals that prions are common and may help organisms survive in changing conditions. (p. 11)
     * HPV screen beats Pap smear
       A test for human papillomavirus outperforms the standard Pap smear in catching precancerous cervical lesions, a study of women age 30 and over shows. (p. 11)
     * Spin control for technology
       Long-lived helix offers a new way to keep electron spin stable and in sync (p. 12)
     * Viruses could power devices
       Viruses -- the biological kind -- could be used to construct more efficient, environmentally friendly lithium ion batteries (p. 12)
     * Ice cubes in space
       Planetary scientists have determined the composition and orbits of two moons at the fringes of the solar system, finding that the bodies were created when an impactor struck the dwarf
       planet that they now orbit. (p. 13)
     * Asteroid tracked from space to Earth
       For the first time, researchers followed an asteroid from space to its crash into Earth, providing the opportunity to study an asteroid in a new way. (p. 13)
