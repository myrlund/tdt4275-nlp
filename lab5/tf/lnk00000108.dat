       Home / Columns / Randomness / Randomness : Reports of junk DNA's 'demise' were based on junky logic and dubious definitions
       Science is an oddly successful enterprise. On the whole, it provides an impressive guide to reality. From antibiotics and atomic bombs to laser beams and X-rays, science enables humans to
       forge powerful tools from nature's secrets. Yet many aspects of science are deeply flawed, from the politicization of research funding to widespread misuse of math in analyzing data. In
       this respect science is not so different from human biology. Magnificent organisms capable of composing symphonies, calculating quantum energy levels and dunking basketballs are built from
       DNA molecules containing 90 perce...

       Home / Columns / Randomness / Randomness : Explanations for time's arrow keep marching on
       Time after time, physicists have tried to explain time. Many claim to have succeeded. But they haven't. Otherwise everybody would quit trying to explain it all over again. One of the most
       recent such efforts comes from the mathematician/cosmologist George F.R. Ellis. He thinks solving the time mystery involves figuring out the difference between the past and the future.
       That's not as obvious as it sounds. Physical laws governing motion make no distinction between future and past. Equations describing the scattering of billiard balls on a pool table work
       equally well if all the balls retr...

       Home / Columns / Randomness / Randomness : Real-life Maxwell's demon adds fuel to debate about status of the second law
       Fight Club had its First Rule (don't talk about Fight Club). The Transporter enforces Rule Number 1 (never change the deal). And NCIS Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs observes Rule 1 (never
       mix the suspects together in the same room). Physics has the second law of thermodynamics. It's weird when you think about it. Movies and TV shows always give their prime rule top billing.
       But the physics rule alleged by Sir Arthur Eddington to hold the "supreme position among the laws of Nature" is only Number 2. Nevertheless, scientists generally consider it the most
       unbreakable law of all. It i...

       Home / Columns / Randomness / Randomness : Poll of quantum physicists shows agreement, disagreement and something in between
       Science is not a democracy. Nature's laws are not subject to the whims of popular vote. A scientific theory succeeds by providing logical explanations for puzzling phenomena and making
       correct predictions about the outcomes of new experiments. It doesn't matter how many scientists believed in the theory beforehand (or even afterward, for that matter). In fact,
       revolutionary new theories are seldom very popular. As Max Planck, the founder of quantum theory, once noted, sometimes a theory doesn't get widely accepted until its opponents die.
       Nevertheless, in certain scientific matters it...

       Home / Columns / Randomness / Randomness : Rules for computing classical probabilities might depend on quantum randomness
       For all the deference to "laws" of nature that supposedly govern everything that happens, the truth is that randomness rules the world. Everywhere you look, randomness is at work, in all
       the processes described by the mathematics of probability. The temperature of the air and the capriciousness of the weather all depend on random collisions of molecules. Computers operate
       on the principles of information theory, which is rooted in quantifying probabilities. Time rushes onward and disorder replaces order by virtue of the probabilistic second law of
       thermodynamics. Randomness determines eve...

       In olden days, before the Star Trek holodeck and movies like TRON and The Matrix, philosophers used to wonder whether life was but a dream. Nowadays they're more concerned that reality
       could be just a computer simulation. Sure, that's not very likely. But you can't rule out the possibility. Computers simulate all sorts of things, and some scientists have seriously
       suggested that nature's supposedly rock-solid reality is really just some smart alien teenager's science fair project. Most people respond to that suggestion with a shrug. What does it
       matter? You have to row, row, row yo...

       For decades, astronomers have grappled with their inability to decipher the universe's darkest secret: the identity of most of its matter. It's not the same stuff as the ordinary atomic
       variety of matter common on Earth. Atoms or their parts -- such as protons and neutrons -- make up less than 17 percent of the mass in the cosmos. All the rest is "dark" -- invisible to
       eyes and telescopes, its presence deduced by its gravitational tug on stars and galaxies (SN: 8/28/10, p. 22). This mystery matter apparently consists of tiny particles of some exotic
       species, but efforts to trap the... (p. 18)

       Making Data Work
       Home / Features / September 8, 2012; Vol.182 #5 / Making Data Work
       A fundamental problem for almost all science is how to tell a fluke from a fact. It's usually very hard to know whether an experiment's result reflects a truth of nature or a random
       accident. So scientists use elaborate math to gauge the odds that a finding is bogus. But those odds rarely offer definitive evidence -- or even much evidence at all. In fact, evidence in
       science is a slippery concept. It's kind of like the U.S. Supreme Court's idea of pornography: Scientists supposedly know evidence when they see it. But they don't know precisely how much
       evidence they've got; stand... (p. 26)
