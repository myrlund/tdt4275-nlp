   issue
     * Primate's Progress: Macaque genome is usefully different
       A group of 35 labs has unveiled a draft of the genome of the rhesus macaque, the most widely used laboratory primate and a cousin to people. (p. 227)
     * Bug versus Bug: Insect virus makes a viable flu vaccine
       A new influenza vaccine churned out by caterpillar cells infected with a genetically engineered virus effectively prevents the flu. (p. 227)
     * Ancient Extract: T. rex fossil yields recognizable protein
       New analyses of a Tyrannosaurus rex leg bone reveal substantial remnants of proteins that strengthen the link between modern birds and dinosaurs. (p. 228)
     * Female Stem Cells Flourish: Sex difference could affect therapies
       Certain adult stem cells from female mice regenerate better than those from males, indicating that not all stem cells are created equal. (p. 228)
     * Quantum Capture: Photosynthesis tries many paths at once
       The wavelike behavior of energy in chlorophyll might explain how plants are so efficient at using solar energy. (p. 229)
     * Agents of Metastasis: Four proteins conspire in breast cancer spread
       Four proteins work together to assist cancer growth and metastasis, and drugs against them inhibit both processes, tests in mice suggest. (p. 229)
     * Disinherited Ancestor: Lucy's kind may occupy evolutionary side branch
       A controversial analysis of a recently discovered jaw from a 3-million-year-old Australopithecus afarensis puts Lucy's species on an evolutionary side branch that eventually died out. (p.
       230)
     * Taken for a Spin
       Considering silk from the spider's perspective may offer the best chance of replicating these creatures' tough threads. (p. 231)
     * Faster, Cheaper, Better
       Methods now under development could make DNA sequencing quicker and less expensive, paving the way for the day when treatments can be tailored to each person's genetic profile. (p. 235)
     * Cavernous findings from Mars
       Images taken by a Mars-orbiting spacecraft show what appear to be caves on the Red Planet. (p. 237)
     * Augmenting the good cholesterol
       A reconstituted version of good cholesterol may lessen the amount of plaque that accumulates in arteries and render existing plaque less dangerous. (p. 237)
     * Rats take fast route to remembering
       Rats use background knowledge about what they have already learned to remember relevant new material surprisingly quickly. (p. 237)
     * Even outdoors, generators pose risks
       Portable electricity generators are frequently the culprit in domestic carbon monoxide poisonings--even when the devices sit outside the home. (p. 237)
     * Enzymes release caged chemicals
       A new controlled-release technology relies on enzymes to unshackle a chemical only when and where it's needed. (p. 238)
     * New agent to spy clogged arteries
       To improve the detection of harmful arterial plaques, researchers have modeled a nanoparticle on a natural material: good cholesterol. (p. 238)
     * Color-tunable sunglasses
       Engineers have developed sunglasses that can change from dark, filtering hues to clear--and back--at the flip of a switch. (p. 238)
     * Gene dispensers
       A new gene therapy technique releases genetic material from successive nanoscale layers of DNA as sheets of polyester that hold them in place slowly degrade. (p. 238)
     * Letters from the April 14, 2007, issue of Science News
       (p. 239)
