       Faint Young Sun
       Scientists struggle to understand how early Earth stayed warm enough for liquid water.
       Nicolle Rager Fuller
     * Magnitude 7.8 earthquake hits Iran
       Casualties reported in nearby Pakistan from temblor.
     * News in Brief: Cuts in some greenhouse gases could slow sea level rise
       Methane, ozone and other short-lived pollutants have a big impact on ocean heights, simulation finds.
     * News in Brief: Rising carbon dioxide means more air turbulence
       More jarring flights are likely, simulation suggests.
     * News in Brief: Isolated coral reefs can regrow after bleaching
       Having neighboring coral reefs is unnecessary for recovery.
     * How the West was done
       The tectonic history of North America's Pacific Rim gets even more jumbled.
     * In Antarctica, melting may beget ice
       Disintegration of floating glaciers could be responsible for freezing of seawater.
     * Fungi pull carbon into northern forest soils
       Organisms living on tree roots do the lion's share of sequestering carbon.
     * Kansas was unbearably hot 270 million years ago
       Temperatures soared to nearly 74 degrees Celsius, which no plants or animals could endure.
     * Landslides detected from afar
       Seismic fingerprints can reveal that a rock avalanche has occurred in a remote location.
     * As Erebus Lives and Breathes
       The Antarctica volcano's long-lived lava lake coughs up clues to the physiology of volcanoes .
     * Microbes flourish at deepest ocean site
       At the bottom of the Mariana Trench, eleven kilometers down, bacteria prosper despite crushing pressure and isolation.
     * News in Brief: Extreme storm surges may occur more often
       Climate simulations suggest hurricane-caused flooding will increase in frequency as temperatures warm.
     * News in Brief: Canada's ice shrinking rapidly
       Melt from Arctic Archipelago will raise sea levels by 3.5 centimeters.
     * Quakes in Slo-Mo
       Barely detectable tremors may portend major destruction.
     * Camel ancestors lived in the Arctic
       Fossils on Ellesmere Island suggest famous desert dweller got its start in cold regions.
     * Impact craters may have been a toasty home for early life
       The heat generated during a cosmic crash could have nurtured ancient organisms.
     * News in Brief: Nutrients matter in tropical forests
       Soil nutrients and rainfall predict tree species range in Panama's tropical forests.
     * Moderate climate warming could melt permafrost
       Ancient cave formations in Siberia reveal effects of warmer past on frozen ground.
     * Aquatic predators affect carbon-storing plant life
       Freshwater predator species can prevent the overgrazing of plants that suck up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
     * Ancestors of today's placental mammals may never have shared the Earth with dinosaurs
       A newly constructed family tree dovetails with the fossil record, but differs considerably from previous genetic studies by suggesting that placental mammals emerged after the dinosaur
       extinction.
     * Salvage Job
       With fertilizer prices skyrocketing, scientists scramble to recover phosphorus from waste.
     * Magnitude 8.0 earthquake strikes Solomon Islands
       Temblor is the largest in a month of seismic activity on Australian-Pacific plate boundary.
     * Gold-digging microbe
       By spitting out a molecule, a bacterium draws solid gold out of solution.
     * News in Brief: Indonesian mud eruption will soon die out, scientists predict
       Spewing muck since 2006, volcano will calm to a sputter by 2017.
     * Life found deep below Antarctic ice
       Lake buried under 800 meters of ice hosts cells, researchers find.
     * Warmer is not always wetter
       Compared to global warming caused by solar radiation, global warming caused by greenhouse gases results in less rainfall, simulations suggest.
     * Watering fields in California boosts rainfall in Southwest
       Irrigation has downstream effects on climate and runoff to Colorado River.
     * News in Brief: Cold spells were dark times in Eastern Europe
       Cooler periods coincided with conflicts and disease outbreaks, a tree-ring study spanning the last millennium finds.
     * News in Brief: Glaciers carve path for future buildup
       Previously sculpted landscapes accumulate ice more quickly than steep valleys.
