       News in Brief: Some like it acidic
       In a higher-carbon world of altered oceans, a shelled plankton species may flourish.
       Univ. of California, Santa Barbara
     * News in Brief: Cuts in some greenhouse gases could slow sea level rise
       Methane, ozone and other short-lived pollutants have a big impact on ocean heights, simulation finds.
     * Puny plastic particles mar Lake Erie's waters
       Polymer particles in the lake carry pollutants.
     * News in Brief: Rising carbon dioxide means more air turbulence
       More jarring flights are likely, simulation suggests.
     * News in Brief: Isolated coral reefs can regrow after bleaching
       Having neighboring coral reefs is unnecessary for recovery.
     * In Antarctica, melting may beget ice
       Disintegration of floating glaciers could be responsible for freezing of seawater.
     * Fungi pull carbon into northern forest soils
       Organisms living on tree roots do the lion's share of sequestering carbon.
     * News in Brief: Termites, not fairies, cause plant circles in African deserts
       Underground insect engineers create water traps in the soil, allowing rings of green grasses in the sand.
     * Disease threatens garden impatiens
       Surprising scientists, once-mild downy mildew has struck the popular blooms in 33 states.
     * Microbes flourish at deepest ocean site
       At the bottom of the Mariana Trench, eleven kilometers down, bacteria prosper despite crushing pressure and isolation.
     * News in Brief: Extreme storm surges may occur more often
       Climate simulations suggest hurricane-caused flooding will increase in frequency as temperatures warm.
     * News in Brief: Canada's ice shrinking rapidly
       Melt from Arctic Archipelago will raise sea levels by 3.5 centimeters.
     * Native pollinators boost crop yields worldwide
       Farms with crops from coffee to mangoes don't get the best yields if they rely solely on honeybees.
     * News in Brief: Nutrients matter in tropical forests
       Soil nutrients and rainfall predict tree species range in Panama's tropical forests.
     * Moderate climate warming could melt permafrost
       Ancient cave formations in Siberia reveal effects of warmer past on frozen ground.
     * Intensive care linked to BPA exposure in newborns
       High levels of pollutant BPA occur in sickest babies, study finds.
     * Blood levels of BPA become source of controversy
       New data question whether human blood measurements of BPA reflect sample contamination or just exaggerated exposures.
     * Aquatic predators affect carbon-storing plant life
       Freshwater predator species can prevent the overgrazing of plants that suck up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
     * News in Brief: Melting Arctic may make algae flourish
       More sunlight penetrates thinning Arctic sea ice, enabling algal growth.
     * Antianxiety drugs affect fish, too
       Perch swim more and eat faster when exposed to concentrations of an antianxiety medication found in rivers.
     * News in Brief: Diversity breeds disease resistance in frogs
       Species-rich amphibian communities prove better at fending off limb-deforming parasitic infections.
     * Compared with rodents, bat species carry more viruses
       Viruses that can jump from animals to people may find the flying mammals a fine place to lurk.
     * Salvage Job
       With fertilizer prices skyrocketing, scientists scramble to recover phosphorus from waste.
     * News in Brief: Indonesian mud eruption will soon die out, scientists predict
       Spewing muck since 2006, volcano will calm to a sputter by 2017.
     * Warmer is not always wetter
       Compared to global warming caused by solar radiation, global warming caused by greenhouse gases results in less rainfall, simulations suggest.
     * Caribbean's coral reefs approach tipping point
       A survey of 19 colonies suggests many may soon begin to shrink.
     * Human-made waste heat warms climate
       Energy dissipated as heat in cities can cause regional temperature changes, simulations suggest.
     * Watering fields in California boosts rainfall in Southwest
       Irrigation has downstream effects on climate and runoff to Colorado River.
     * News in Brief: Chemical tied to intergenerational obesity
       Mice ingesting the compound tributyltin pass effects to grandchildren.
     * News in Brief: Cold spells were dark times in Eastern Europe
       Cooler periods coincided with conflicts and disease outbreaks, a tree-ring study spanning the last millennium finds.
