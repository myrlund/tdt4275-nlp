     * Spreading a scientific way of life
       People
       Give a man a fish and he'll have a seafood supper. Teach a man engineering principles and he could start an aquafarm, devise a better net or fishing pole or maybe even come up with an
       entirely new way to combat chronic fishlessness. 04.18.13 | more >>
     * Prisons an unlikely laboratory
       People
       Graduate student Craig Ulrich carried out his first published research project not in a university lab, but as a prison inmate. 04.04.13 | more >>
     * A genetic exhibitionist
       People
       Harvard geneticist Joseph Pickrell is part of a new generation of scientists talking about their data not just over the lab bench, but in conversations online. Pickrell uses the Internet to
       open himself, his research and his thoughts about others' work to public scrutiny. 03.20.13 | more >>
     * Baseball's resident physicist
       People
       Picture sitting at a baseball park, leisurely watching a game. Your mind wanders, torn between a box of Cracker Jack and the conversation drifting down from the row behind you. Suddenly the
       crack of a bat snaps you to attention, and you scan the field for the ball. Physicist Alan Nathan would say your attention is piqued because well-hit balls make a different noise than weak
       pop-ups do. 03.07.13 | more >>
     * Exploring NASA's quirky places
       People
       View zoomable JPL map One building houses what has been deemed the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's "best bathroom." Another, an atomic clock. And naturally the scientists and engineers at
       the Pasadena, Calif., lab that built the Curiosity rover have a Mars Yard that simulates the surface of the Red Planet, complete with rocks and sand. 02.21.13 | more >>
     * Rare disease sets mom's research agenda
       People
       Rare disease sets mom's research agendaWhen a child is diagnosed with a mysterious disease, the lives of everyone in the family change. But when Leslie Gordon's son Sam was diagnosed with a
       rare premature aging disease, the lives of dozens of families changed. As a pediatrician and medical researcher at Brown University, Gordon set out to learn what caused her son's condition
       and how to ... 02.07.13 | more >>
     * Tackling women's pro football
       People
       Tackling women's pro footballJennifer Carter's research on women's professional football is so hard-hitting that it left her bruised and nursing a torn hamstring. Carter, a graduate student
       in sociology at the University of Cincinnati, started observing the inner workings of a team in the Women's Football Alliance from the sidelines during the 2011 season. Her goal: to figure
       out how ... 01.24.13 | more >>
     * Through a glass, less darkly
       People
       After finishing his Ph.D. on glass formation, chemical physicist Patrick Charbonneau thought he'd never study the material again. But something kept nagging him: In some experiments,
       materials would unexpectedly morph into glass, solid as a rock but molecularly disordered like a liquid. The results didn't match with glass-formation theory, but they were easy to dismiss
       as a fluke. "If I ... 01.10.13 | more >>
     * Contest brings out the biohackers
       People
       Mix one part enthusiasm, two parts engineering and three parts biology -- and you've got a recipe for do-it-yourself genetic engineering. 12.27.12 | more >>
     * Alt science
       People
       View the video After a day of computer programming and poring over genetic data, Pardis Sabeti relaxes her brain by writing rock songs. 12.14.12 | more >>
     * Fly guy
       People
       Brian Brown can discover a new kind of fly anywhere. He often takes up the search in exotic locales such as New Zealand, Chile or Taiwan, but he's not picky. Once, he was challenged to find
       a new species in a Los Angeles backyard. After setting a trap and waiting, he pulled out a winner: "Turns out it was a new species, the first thing I pulled out of there," he says. And it
       wasn't a ... 11.29.12 | more >>
     * Building robots that slither
       People
       View the videos Howie Choset is a roboticist, but his team's creations bear little resemblance to C-3PO or R2-D2. Instead, Choset finds inspiration in nature -- specifically, snakes.

     * Insect illustrator
       People
       For 10 years, Taina Litwak's job was to draw almost nothing but mosquitoes. As a science illustrator in Washington, D.C., for the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Litwak helped
       document disease-transmitting species that might endanger soldiers overseas.
       T. Litwak 11.02.12 | more >>
     * The man behind Sarcastic Rover
       People
       NASA's newest rover, Curiosity, wasn't alone on Mars for long.
       Two hours after Curiosity landed in Gale Crater on August 6, her cranky alter-ego plopped down with a huff on the Red Planet. That is, a virtual alter ego named Sarcastic Rover appeared on
       Twitter and began updating followers about her exploits. "Oh sure," she tweeted early on. "I can't think of anything I'd rather be doing than driving around a wasteland looking at dirt for
       the rest of ... 10.20.12 | more >>
     * Protecting the planet
       People
       Catharine "Cassie" Conley has the coolest job title at NASA: She's the agency's planetary protection officer. (The best title used to be "director of the universe," but a reconfiguration a
       few years back eliminated that job description, she says.) 10.19.12 | more >>
     * Spider man fell for jumpers
       People
       View the videos
       At age 13, Wayne Maddison spied the metallic-green jaws of a spider marooned on a raft of vegetation floating on Lake Ontario. He rescued the young creature, and ultimately made a pet of
       her and one of her young. Along the way, he fell in love with their family -- jumping spiders. That intense affection has never waned. Forty years later, Maddison, now scientific codirector
       of the Beaty ... 10.05.12 | more >>
     * Exploring the science of cooking
       People
       When a group of women in Lisbon, Portugal, entered a cooking contest in 2006, they decided to put their own spin on a Portuguese fish soup. The team created green fettuccine from gelatin
       flavored with coriander and garlic, meant to mimic an algae bed. Egg yolk-sized spheres, made of algae extract and filled with fish soup, nestled on top. 09.21.12 | more >>
     * The volcano watcher
       People
       Matt Patrick's office is perched not far from the summit of Hawaii's busiest volcano: Kilauea. When it erupts, he has a good view. Of course, it's his job to see every possible vista of the
       peak, whether it's flying over in a helicopter, hiking to fissures and along lava fields or checking webcams, seismometers and satellites. Working at the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian
       Volcano ... 09.07.12 | more >>
     * Creating small wonders
       People
       Cell biologist and inventor Gary Greenberg's career took a turn about 10 years ago when his brother sent him a canister of beach sand. Greenberg placed a pinch under a light microscope.
       Magnified hundreds of times, the colorful, intricate sand grains resembled beads from a necklace. 08.24.12 | more >>
     * Saving primates with a dog and scat
       People
       View the video
       Joseph Orkin has found an unusual way to study highly endangered -- and highly elusive -- primates in southwestern China. Orkin hikes into isolated mountaintop forests accompanied by a
       four-legged assistant who avidly sniffs out scat left by black-crested gibbons and Phayre's leaf monkeys. 08.10.12 | more >>
     * Comic strip science
       People
       "I am so awesome." [Smug grin.]
       So goes the final frame in a humorous comic called "Birds are Gross," in which artist and field naturalist Rosemary Mosco highlights the virtues of the turkey vulture. The bird, speaking
       throughout ("I am a turkey vulture. Yes indeed."), reaches this conclusion after announcing its proclivities for things like projectile vomiting and poop-mediated temperature control.
