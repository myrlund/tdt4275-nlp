     * See Blind Mice: Algae gene makes sightless eyes sense light
       Scientists have prompted mouse-eye cells that aren't normally light sensitive to respond to light. (p. 211)
     * Ring around the Pulsar: Planets may form in a harsh environment
       Astronomers have found a disk that has the potential to make planets in the harsh environment surrounding the ultradense remains of an exploded star. (p. 211)
     * Wired Viruses: New electrodes could make better batteries
       With the aid of a bacteria-infecting virus, researchers have engineered cobalt oxide-and-gold nanowires that can be used as electrodes for lithium-ion batteries. (p. 212)
     * Polyp Stopper: Controversial drug may prevent colon growths
       An anti-inflammatory drug currently prescribed for arthritis and pain can prevent formation of precancerous growths in the colon and rectum. (p. 213)
     * Mystery Drilling: Ancient teeth endured dental procedures

     * A Shot against Pandemic Flu: Vaccines would play pivotal role in response
       Mass vaccination should be the linchpin of the U.S. response to an influenza pandemic, according to new computer simulations. (p. 213)

       The humble bladder is now the world's first bioengineered internal organ to work in people. (p. 214)
     * Spin City
       Researchers are using a technique called electrospinning to create fibrous mats that have potential applications in drug delivery, wound care, and tissue engineering. (p. 216)
     * Revealing Covert Actions
       The recent merger of high-speed video technology and centuries-old techniques for seeing ordinarily invisible fluctuations of the air is enabling engineers to visualize and study the
       previously unseen, large-scale behavior of shock waves in explosions and aerodynamics research. (p. 218)
     * Parasite can't survive without its tail
       The protozoan that causes African sleeping sickness can't survive in the mammalian bloodstream without its long, whiplike tail. (p. 221)

     * Volcanic mineral caused rare cancer in Turkey
       In two Turkish villages, nearly half of all deaths since 1980 have resulted from a form of cancer caused by inhaling erionite, a brittle and fibrous volcanic mineral that looks similar to
       wool. (p. 222)
     * Letters from the April 8, 2006, issue of Science News
