       Planetary Cousins In this artist's conception, the five planets orbiting the star Kepler-62 all have orbits smaller than Earth's. The planets 62e and 62f are in the star's habitable zone,

     * Circumcision changes penis biology
       Uncircumcised men harbor more bacteria around the head of the penis than do circumcised men, and the mix of microbial species is decidedly different in the two groups, researchers find.

     * Disputed signs of consciousness seen in babies' brains
       Babies' brains emit electrical bursts that signal a budding awareness of the visual world by the time they are 5 months old, a new study concludes. But some researchers are skeptical that
       these neural surges correspond to conscious experience. 04.18.13 | more >>
     * Most Earthlike planets yet seen bring Kepler closer to its holy grail
       They're not quite Earth's twins, but they might be its big sisters. Two planets slightly larger than Earth have been found by NASA's Kepler space telescope. The planets circle their star at
       a distance seemingly just right for life. Detailed in research published April 18 in Science, the two planets are likely the first of many that, at least from a distance, look a whole lot

       VIEW THE VIDEO Parents trying to soothe a fussy infant might want to invest in a sling to carry their kid.
       In human infants and mouse pups, bumping along in their mothers' arms (or mouths) acts as the ultimate pacifier: crying stops, fidgety bodies go still and racing hearts thump more slowly,
       researchers report April 18 in Current Biology. 04.18.13 | more >>

       A magnitude 7.8 earthquake rattled southeastern Iran April 16 at 3:14 p.m. local time. The quake struck about 80 kilometers east of the city of Khash in a thinly populated mountainous
       region near the border with Pakistan. The jolt was felt as far away as northern India and throughout parts of the Middle East. 04.16.13 | more >>
     * Bioengineered kidney transplanted into rat
       By stripping a kidney of its cells and repopulating it with new ones, scientists have shown in a rat that a bioengineered kidney can function to some extent like a normal one. The work,
       published April 14 in Nature Medicine, reveals that the protein scaffold of a kidney provides the architecture and chemical cues that new cells need to adopt the roles of kidney cells.

     * Dark matter detector reports hints of WIMPs
       DENVER -- Ultracold crystals designed to catch particles of dark matter deep underground have come up with three potential detections, physicists reported April 13 at a meeting of the

     * Group size affects racial makeup of friend groups
       Being able to choose friends from larger populations discourages friendships with people from other races, finds a study examining the mathematical underpinnings of self-seeking behavior
       and group size. The results suggest that activities that give people from different backgrounds the opportunity to work together in the classroom can promote multicultural friendships among
       students. 04.15.13 | more >>
