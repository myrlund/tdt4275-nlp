   Similar brain patterns emerge when seeing an object and conjuring it during sleep

   A computer can decode the stuff of dreams. By comparing brain activity during sleep with activity patterns collected while study participants looked at certain objects, a computer learned to
   identify some contents of people's unconscious reveries.

   "It's striking work," says cognitive psychologist Frank Tong of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, who was not involved in the research. "It's a demonstration that brain activity during
   dreaming is very similar to activity during wakefulness."

   The work, reported April 4 in Science by Japanese researchers led by Yukiyasu Kamitani of Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International, adds to somewhat scant knowledge of how
   the brain constructs dreams, says Tong. The research could lead to a better understanding of what the brain does during different states of consciousness, such as those experienced by some coma
   patients.

   Dreams are a bit of a black box and difficult to study. Experiments with mice have revealed aspects of sleep and dreaming, such as how the experiences contribute to forming memories. But a
   mouse can't tell you what it dreamed about. And the sleep stage that's richest in dreams -- REM sleep -- typically kicks in about 90 minutes after a person conks out, making it time consuming
   to gather data on dreams. The noisy fMRI brain scanning machine doesn't help.

   To skirt these experimental issues, the researchers recorded brain activity in three adult male volunteers during the early stages of sleep. After the subjects had dozed off, they were
   repeatedly awakened and asked for detailed reports on what they had seen while sleeping. In an example, one participant stated: "Well, there were persons, about three persons, inside some sort
   of hall. There was a male, a female and maybe like a child. Ah, it was like a boy, a girl and a mother. I don't think that there was any color."

   After gathering at least 200 such reports from the three men, the researchers used a lexical database to group the dreamed objects in coarse categories, such as street, furniture and girl. Then
   the study participants looked at images of things in those categories, while their brains were again scanned. Computer algorithms sorted through these patterns of brain activity, linking
   particular patterns with objects.

   When the computer went back to the brain scans taken during dreaming, it did a pretty good job of distinguishing some of the signals, such as whether a dream contained a book or a girl. On
   average, the computer could pick which of two objects had appeared in a dream 70 percent of the time, a rate that is much better than would be expected by chance.

   "To be able to get enough data to do this kind of analysis is really impressive," says Russell Poldrack, a neuroimaging expert at the University of Texas at Austin.

   The study bolsters the notion that the vivid imagery of dreams, no matter how fantastic, is as real as waking life, Kamitani says, at least from the brain's perspective. Further research may
   reveal if the same is true about other dreamed senses, such as experienced sounds or emotions.

   After monitoring a man's brain activity while he looked various kinds of objects (top images), scientists trained a computer to decode patterns of brain activity recorded while the man dreamed.
   The computer could distinguish among many dreamed objects. The size of the word in the word cloud (bottom) indicates the likelihood that that object was in the dream.

     * I think that dreams are interrelated to each other and while you can see yourself in a building with some arrangement of people you know, you can also see roads from another country or
       yourself in a more complete but not as detailed manner. It is also possible that in dreams you might exert some influence on the "foreign structure" that is shown to you, but this
       limitation is influenced by the intensity of exerting your dream world. You don't have a basis in dreams, which is why you feel agitation due to not being able to distinguish the true
       nature of dreams as compared to real life. As a result, most of action that seem conditioned in dreams have a minimal influence during that time, which is why they seem familiar or similar
       to each other (because of the possibilities you have in a dream state).

     * Can we learn to do without sleep? Are insomniacs merely leading the way?

     * Where to start! We have lots of ground to cover, but I will try to touch on just a few of them:
       * Forget the 90 minute REM dealio (that's old school). Everyone has experienced the "kick" when falling asleep. It's when you're dozing off into sleep, but slightly conscious & you enter
       REM....your body will "kick."
       * Next, the article has some cryptic messages (hidden meanings/research), but implies certain observations that only someone who understands such things would pick up.
       * Next, improve the research by getting rid of the poor quality test subjects. For example, someone should remember all the details of their dream; not nonsensical/flimsy commentary like "I
       think there were 3 people in the room & I think it was like a beaver or a huckleberry."
       * Yes dreams are exactly like our "awakened-time." It should include all senses and the dreams transcend time (i.e. you can have fragments of memories in the past conjoined to the present,
       and even the future).
       * Yes emotions can be a major part to construction and implementation of dreams.
       * However, it the strangers and objects/images we've never experienced in our lives that are fascinating to me!!!!
       Although I found the research quite intriguing and I think it was "dumb-downed" for viewers and hidden strategic purposes, it falls short of OMNI magazine's reporting of decades ago (re:
       can you control your dreams, if so, what can you do & what have you learned).
       Keep up the good work! Personally, I would like to see the "hidden" research :)

     * Nice hypothesis with Lexical, but I find it weak at best. Get to the concrete matter of things.

     * getting to such a level in neurotech is simply thrilling, what we watch in fiction will soon turn real
