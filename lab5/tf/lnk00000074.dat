     * Earth in Action : Geologists develop weapons to combat that sinkhole feeling
       Home / Columns / Earth in Action / Earth in Action : Geologists develop weapons to combat that sinkhole feeling
       What do five Porsches, several Kentucky thoroughbreds and a three-story building in Guatemala City have in common? They've all been swallowed by sinkholes. Sadly, the sudden cave-ins
       sometimes claim people's lives as well. On February 28 the earth opened up underneath the Seffner, Fla., bedroom of Jeff Bush, entombing him. The freak accident highlighted Florida's
       vulnerability to sinkholes, and the seemingly sheer randomness of death by earth. But geologists are fighting back. The battle isn't just one man versus the ground; it's science versus
       society's tendency to put structur...

     * Earth in Action : When an asteroid heads for Earth, it's time to reconsider those doomsday plans
       Home / Columns / Earth in Action / Earth in Action : When an asteroid heads for Earth, it's time to reconsider those doomsday plans
       Chicken Little is right. The sky is falling. The million-plus people living in Chelyabinsk, Russia, got that message on February 15, when a space rock some 17 meters across detonated over
       their homes. People rushed to the windows in wonderment as a blaze of light arced through the sky; seconds later many of them got a face full of glass shards. It was the most damaging
       cosmic collision since 1908, when an even bigger asteroid chunk blew up over Siberia. (In an era before YouTube and dashboard cameras, it was weeks before tales trickled out of reindeer
       herders being thrown from their tents by ...

     * Earth in Action : Italian earthquake verdict exposes rifts between science and society
       Home / Columns / Earth in Action / Earth in Action : Italian earthquake verdict exposes rifts between science and society
       Sometimes a little shake-up is exactly what scientists need to make a major breakthrough. Other times it can send them to jail. Six Italian researchers and one government official have each
       been sentenced to six years in prison for their role in communicating -- or failing to communicate -- seismic risks in L'Aquila, Italy. That beautiful medieval town was devastated by a
       magnitude 6.3 earthquake in the wee hours of April 6, 2009. More than 300 people died; the aftershocks reverberated not only across Italy but also throughout the global network of
       seismologists. "We've all been take...

       Factory of Life
       Home / Features / January 12, 2013; Vol.183 #1 / Factory of Life
       Quietly, on the top floor of a nondescript commercial building overlooking Boston Harbor, the future is being born. Rows of young scientists tap intently in front of computer monitors,
       their concentration unbroken even as the occasional plane from Logan Airport buzzes by. State-of-the-art lab equipment hums away in the background. This office, in Boston's Marine
       Industrial Park, is what California's Silicon Valley was four decades ago -- the vanguard of an industry that will change your life. Just as researchers from Stanford provided the brains
       behind the semiconductor revolution, so a... (p. 22)

       Mix one part enthusiasm, two parts engineering and three parts biology -- and you've got a recipe for do-it-yourself genetic engineering. Every November, college kids from Michigan to
       Munich descend on MIT, eager to show off their biohacking skills. In the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition, teams battle one another to build the coolest
       synthetically altered organisms. If you want to create a microbe that will sniff out and destroy contaminants in mining waste ponds, or a cell that will produce drugs right in your body,
       iGEM is for you. Pioneers of synthetic b... (p. 32)
