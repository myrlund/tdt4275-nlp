   Science News RSS Feeds

   What is RSS?

   RSS (or Really Simple Syndication) is a way to share content without requiring readers to constantly visit a website to see what's new. An RSS feed contains article headlines, summaries and
   links to the full text of articles or Web pages.

   What tools do I need to use RSS?

   To start using RSS, you need a special news reader or aggregator that displays RSS content feeds from websites that you select. There are many different news readers available, many of which
   are free of charge. Most are available as desktop software that you download and install on your computer. Several Web-based news readers are available as well.

   List of news readers (Google)

   Once you have set up your news reader, you simply subscribe to the RSS content feeds that you want.

   What are the benefits of using RSS?

   RSS is an easy way for you to be alerted when content that interests you appears on your favorite websites. Instead of visiting a particular website to browse for new articles and features, RSS
   automatically tells you when something new is posted online.

   Click on the link to obtain the RSS URL, which you will see in the "Address" field of of your browser. Simply copy this URL and follow the instructions for your particular news reader to
   subscribe.
