   Application information

   The deadline for submitting applications for the fourth NUFU Period (2007 - 2011) has passed. Initially the applications were evaluated externally. The next step in the process was an
   institutional assessment of each application by the institutions in the South and in the North. The NUFU Board made the final decision based on the external evaluations and institutional
   priorities. The priorities of the institutions in the South counts twice as much as the priorities made in the North.
