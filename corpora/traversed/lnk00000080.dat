For students allocated housing at the student village, SiT

   The information in this webpage only concerns students who are informed that they are allocated housing at the student village, SiT.

   Unfortunately it is not possible to take into account special wishes from students concerning the location of the housing, who you want to live with etc. It is not possible to obtain a family
   or couple apartment at SiT. However, after you have moved in at your single room, you may apply internally to SiT for another room or apartment.
   Please note: You must under no circumstances apply for a new room before you have arrived and moved in at your original allocated room . This means that you must accept the original offer as
   stated in the contract (pay the deposit and signing the contract). Be also aware that there is no guarantee that you will be allocated another room and that getting the room of your wish might
   take several months to obtain. You might find relevant information regarding family/couples apartments at this webpage

   Students who get a room at SiT will receive a contract which will be sent to you by e-mail. All necessary information regarding accommodation will be included in the contract.
   Accepted students for spring 2012 who are allocated housing at SiT will in most cases, unless you have previously informed us that you would like an earlier starting date of your housing
   contract, get a room from around January 2. The room may be available some days later than this. You will have to pay rent from the starting date in the contract. If your arrival is later than
   the starting date you still need to pay rent from this date on.

   Please note: In order to reserve your room in the student village, SiT need you to pay a deposit of NOK 5000, - to SiT's account as stated in the contract (the deposit will be payed back to
   your account after you have moved out unless you have not followed SiT's rules). After you have received the contract you must transfer the deposit and fax or e-mail the receipt of the deposit,
   sign the contract and return this to SiT within the deadline.

   If this rule is not obeyed, SiT will cancel your booking and the Office of International Relations will immediately allocate the room to another student! You must then arrange for private
   housing on your own.

   After you have received the contract you should contact SiT (not the Office of International Relations) if you have any questions related to housing, the contract etc. at the student village.

   If you have received a contract from SiT and for some reason do not accept the contract or want to cancel it please inform both the Office of International Relations (housing@adm.ntnu.no) and
   SiT, bolig@sit.no.
