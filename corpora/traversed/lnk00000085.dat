IFUS programme overview

   The IFUS programme is a full-year course of study designed to teach Norwegian to international students who wish to pursue a degree at NTNU.

   Although NTNU offers more than 30 international masters programmes, all of our bachelor's programmes and a significant number of master's programmes are taught in Norwegian. If you want to
   pursue one of these degrees, you need to fulfill the univerity's Norwegian language requirements as well as other programme-specific requirements. Successful completion of the IFUS course
   enables you to do this.

   IFUS programme graduates are also guaranteed a place in one of the university's bachelor's or master's courses (with certain exceptions, see below) if you have applied directly from abroad. If
   you already live in Norway, the university cannot guarantee you admission after you graduate from IFUS. Instead, you must compete with other Norwegian students for a place at NTNU by applying
   through NUCAS, the Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service. You can read more about the application procedure for students already resident in Norway lower on this page.

   Programme content
   As a IFUS student, you learn the skills you need to master written and spoken Norwegian in academic as well as everyday situations. We also introduce you to Norwegian culture and society.

   The course begins with the basics of Norwegian grammar, syntax and phonetics, and progresses to expanding your vocabulary and knowledge of idiomatic expressions. You also have access to
   listening and pronunciation exercises in the language laboratory. IFUS is worth 60 credits in the Norwegian system. Lectures start in August and last 28 weeks, with 12 hours of class
   instruction and 1 hour of conversation per week. The course ends in mid-May.

   Beyond IFUS
   If you apply to IFUS directly from abroad and are accepted to the programme, you are also guaranteed admission to continue your studies at NTNU. This means that you must list a minimum of three
   alternative degree programmes on your application that you would like to pursue at NTNU. Your admissions letter for the IFUS programme will also include information about where you have been
   accepted to study after you have completed IFUS. However, you cannot apply to an International Master's programme, medicine or professional studies in psychology, music and fine arts through
   the IFUS program.

   Financing
   Athough NTNU does not have tuition fees, you must be able to document your ability to support yourself during your studies in Norway. If you cannot provide this documentation, we cannot offer
   you a place in the programme. Unfortunately you will not be able to apply for financial aid through the Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund, or other government and university grants and
   loans. (The only exception is for applicants married to Norwegian citizens who may qualify for support from the State Educational Loan Fund.)

   Who can apply?
   If you meet the minimum entrance requirements, and can document the ability to finance your studies, you are welcome to apply. However, IFUS is primarily for applicants who intend to study at
   NTNU after the completion of the programme. You may also apply if you have an agreement with your home institution to take this course as part of your studies. But note that you cannot have
   attended any previous Norwegian courses, or have any prior knowledge of the language.

   If you live in Norway now
   If you currently live in Norway, you may apply to IFUS, but we can only accept you if the course has places available after we have accepted eligible students who have applied from abroad.
   Remember, you won't be guaranteed a place at NTNU after IFUS, but must apply through NUCAS by March 1st in the year you intend to start your regular studies. Note that most master's programmes
   have their own deadlines and application forms, found on NTNU's "Søknadsweb". NTNU's webpages also contain comprehensive information regarding degree programmes taught in Norwegian.

   The admission requirements for applicants residing in Norway are the same as for regular applicants, except that you do not have to document funding availability or plans of study after IFUS.
   The application deadline for applicants residing in Norway is June 1st in the year you intend to start the IFUS programme. The application form is usually available starting in February each
   year.

   Deadlines and application dates
   December 1st - PRELIMINARY APPLICATION : The preliminary application deadline for the IFUS programme is December 1st for the following academic year. (Applicants residing in Norway will be
   rejected).

   February 15th - FINAL APPLICATION : Qualified candidates receive the final application form in January, which has to be returned by February 15th.

   April- ACCEPTANCE LETTERS SENT - The admissions process will normally be finalized by the end of April.

   June 1st - Application deadline for applicants already residing in Norway.

   The selection process
   The places in the IFUS programme are strictly reserved for candidates with good academic qualifications and ability to document sufficient funding for their studies. A maximum of 15 students
   may be admitted to this programme each year. Applicants residing abroad will be given priority. Applicants residing in Norway will be considered when possible.

Welcome Programme !

   We strongly encourage all new students to attend the orientation/welcome program at the beginning of each semester. It is an ideal opportunity to become acquainted with NTNU and Trondheim, have
   a good time and make some new friends.
