Family and couples apartment at the student village(SiT)

   Please note that you should under no circumstances consider bringing your family with you at the time of your arrival in Trondheim. It is strictly forbidden to have another person living in
   your single room at the student village, and this also applies to children of any age.

   There is normally quite a long waiting list for family and couples accommodation in the student village. We recommend all students who want to apply for a family reunion to contact the Office
   of International Relations for important information regarding this after their arrival in Trondheim.
   There is normally quite a long waiting list for family and couples accommodation in the student village, this subject to availability (per August 2011 it takes approximately up to 4-5 months to
   get the desired accommodation. However it may even take some months longer). Students who already live at the student village may apply for family/couples housing at the student village at:
   http://www.unieiendom.no/sit/
   Please note: Students who are not holding a room at the student village and are living privately in Trondheim, must apply through the Office of International Relations for family housing at the
   student village. Please contact housing@adm.ntnu.no

   For family apartments: You need to give documentation of your child/ren/ or pregnancy. The name of spouse must also be given at the time of applying. Applicants with children will be given
   priority on the waiting list.
   For couples apartment:  The name of the spouse must be given at the time of applying. If you are willing to share kitchen and bath room with 2-3 other couples it may be easier finding an
   apartment. Please inform us if you may share kitchen/bathroom with other couples.
   Note: Students applying for family or couples apartments are responsible for updating their application with SiT every second month.

   At the time of applying for family housing you should either write a comment in the application form that your family is waiting for visa or contact the reception at Moholt after registering
   your application.  This in order to avoid that you get an offer for a family apartment and your family's visa for family reunification is still under processing.

   You should note that it is strictly forbidden to bring your family into your single room/shared kitchen accommodation. If you do so, you will lose the right to stay in the Student Village.

    It should also be mentioned that the private market for accommodation is very expensive in Trondheim.
