   4. Withdrawal from examination

   5. Handing in the answer paper
   Each sheet of the answer paper has a copy which is torn off and kept by the candidate. If there is no time to make a fair copy, sheets of rough paper may be handed in as part of the answer
   paper. The sheets of rough paper will be part of the answer paper and the total number of sheets handed in is noted on the cover page. All unused sheets of paper are to be handed in.

   It is not permitted to take any paper out of the examination hall before the answer paper has been handed in.
