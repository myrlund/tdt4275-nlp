How to apply

   Applying to NTNU to earn an undergraduate or ordinary master's degree is easy by using the centralized application processing centre called NUCAS, the Norwegian Universities and Colleges
   Admission Service (Samordnet opptak). Applications for international master's and PhD programmes are made directly to the university. Here's what you need to know.

   The deadline for foreign student applications is March 1, while for students with high school degrees from a Nordic country, the deadline is April 15. The online application form at NUCAS is
   available from February 1 of the year you wish to attend university, and can be used to apply for bachelor's and integrated master's degrees (a five year study programme which results in a
   master's, with no intermediate bachelor's degree), where the language of instruction is in Norwegian. In fact, all of NUCAS's important forms are in Norwegian, because if you don't understand
   Norwegian, you will need to use a different application procedure. A complete list (in Norwegian) of all of NTNU's programmes that use the NUCAS application form can be found here.

   Alternatives for non-Norwegian speakers
   If you want to study in Norway for an undergraduate degree but don't speak Norwegian, NTNU offers two different Norwegian language courses that will enable you to meet the language
   requirements.

   If you have the required undergraduate or graduate training but don't speak Norwegian, you can apply directly to NTNU for the following:
     * International master's degree programmes
     * PhD programmes

   Undergraduate and ordinary master's degree admissions process
   In general, admission to NTNU is highly competitive, particularly for engineering, architecture, and medicine. A strong grade average is an essential prerequisite to secure a place. Medicine,
   engineering and architecture also have special requirements in mathematics and physics.

   Applying to NTNU is a two-step process:
     * First, you need to fill out the NUCAS application form online (in Norwegian), which includes selecting the courses of study you wish to pursue, and the university/college where you want to
       study. You can choose as many as 10 different courses of study. A searchable list of courses and programmes is available here (only in Norwegian). The deadline for students educated outside
       of Scandinavia is March 1.
     * Then, when your application is registered, NUCAS will send you a form called an omslagsark (application file) in the post. This is where you provide information about your education, with
       relevant and officially certified copies of certificates, diplomas and transcripts from your high school/upper secondary school education. If your documents are not in English or a
       Scandinavian language, you will have to provide an authorized translation. You should receive this form no later than June 1. If you have not received it by this date, contact NUCAS
       immediately, and no later than June 10. The omslagsark must be returned to NUCAS before July 1.

   Decisions dates and other deadlines
   Places are offered to students by July 20. This process assumes that the student either is currently residing in Norway, or is eligible for Norwegian residency. Students who live abroad and who
   want to apply using this process may find that the late notification date makes it difficult to obtain a student residency permit in a timely manner.

   Certain departments/programmes have different deadlines, so it is best to check the web sites for the programmes you are interested in.

   Application exceptions:

   Not all NTNU programmes use the NUCAS application process. A complete desciption of the programmes where the language of instruction is in Norwegian but where the application is made directly
   to NTNU can be found here. All require proficiency in Norwegian except for the international master's programme. In general, applications (in Norwegian) can be made directly to NTNU for:
     * Two-year master's programmes
     * Two-year international master's programme
     * Two-year master's programme in technology
     * Music performance
     * Psychology (professional degree)
     * Dance Studies
     * Teacher training, full-time (PPU)
     * Teacher training, part-time (FPPU)
