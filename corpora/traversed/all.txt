NTNU News

   Climate events can drive high-arctic population dynamics
   (17.01.2013) Climate change is known to affect the population dynamics of single species, such as reindeer or caribou, but the effect of climate at the community level has been much more
   difficult to document. Now, a group of researchers led by scientists from NTNU's Centre for Conservation Biology have documented this effect, as reported in the 18 Jan. 2013 issue of Science.

   NTNU professor named to Nature's list of top commentators
   (02.01.2013) Your morning cup of coffee just might be contributing to species extinction, says Edgar Hertwich, director of NTNU's Industrial Ecology Programme, in a commentary for Nature
   magazine. His pointed commentary won the professor a place as one of the publication's top commentaries for 2012.

Study programmes for degree students

   If you speak Norwegian or any other Scandinavian language, you have your choice of virtually all study programmes at NTNU for undergraduate and master's degree students, depending upon your
   other educational qualifications.

   Illustrasjonsbilde/FOTO

   The online catalogue provides a wealth of information about each course offering, while the list of study programmes gives a broad overview of the different degree programmes available from
   NTNU. But remember, admission to NTNU's ordinary degree programmes requires that you be able to demonstrate your proficiency in Norwegian. If you want to attend NTNU to obtain an ordinary
   bachelor's or master's degree but don't speak Norwegian, read about your alternatives here.

   Having a hard time deciding what course of study to pursue? Try sampling the webpages for different departments and faculties, which can give you a sense of the kinds of jobs and research
   opportunties that would await you as a graduate.

   Degree students

Admission requirements

   The admissions process is determined by the degree you choose to pursue and its associated language requirements.

   Illustrasjonsbilde/FOTO

   If you meet the Norwegian language requirements, or have a related Scandinavian language as your mother tongue, you can apply to any of NTNU's degree programmes, but you also must demonstrate
   that you meet the English language requirements.

   If you do not meet the Norwegian language requirements and want to study for a degree offered only in Norwegian, you can meet the proficiency requirements by studying Norwegian full-time with
   the IFUS Programme. You can also take the Bergen test to prove your proficiency. NTNU offers different short-term or part-time Norwegian courses, an intensive month-long class in the summer, as
   well as semester-long classes, which can help you prepare for the Bergen test. Successful completion of three semesters of Norwegian taught at NTNU is considered to be the equivalent of passing
   the Bergen test.

   If you wish to study for a degree taught in English, but English is not your native language, you must meet the English language requirements.

   A summary of all language requirements is available in a booket entitled "Study at NTNU" (pdf).

How to apply

   Applying to NTNU to earn an undergraduate or ordinary master's degree is easy by using the centralized application processing centre called NUCAS, the Norwegian Universities and Colleges
   Admission Service (Samordnet opptak). Applications for international master's and PhD programmes are made directly to the university. Here's what you need to know.

   Illustrasjonsbilde/FOTO

   The deadline for foreign student applications is March 1, while for students with high school degrees from a Nordic country, the deadline is April 15. The online application form at NUCAS is
   available from February 1 of the year you wish to attend university, and can be used to apply for bachelor's and integrated master's degrees (a five year study programme which results in a
   master's, with no intermediate bachelor's degree), where the language of instruction is in Norwegian. In fact, all of NUCAS's important forms are in Norwegian, because if you don't understand
   Norwegian, you will need to use a different application procedure. A complete list (in Norwegian) of all of NTNU's programmes that use the NUCAS application form can be found here.

   Alternatives for non-Norwegian speakers
   If you want to study in Norway for an undergraduate degree but don't speak Norwegian, NTNU offers two different Norwegian language courses that will enable you to meet the language
   requirements.

   If you have the required undergraduate or graduate training but don't speak Norwegian, you can apply directly to NTNU for the following:
     * International master's degree programmes
     * PhD programmes

   Undergraduate and ordinary master's degree admissions process
   In general, admission to NTNU is highly competitive, particularly for engineering, architecture, and medicine. A strong grade average is an essential prerequisite to secure a place. Medicine,
   engineering and architecture also have special requirements in mathematics and physics.

   Applying to NTNU is a two-step process:
     * First, you need to fill out the NUCAS application form online (in Norwegian), which includes selecting the courses of study you wish to pursue, and the university/college where you want to
       study. You can choose as many as 10 different courses of study. A searchable list of courses and programmes is available here (only in Norwegian). The deadline for students educated outside
       of Scandinavia is March 1.
     * Then, when your application is registered, NUCAS will send you a form called an omslagsark (application file) in the post. This is where you provide information about your education, with
       relevant and officially certified copies of certificates, diplomas and transcripts from your high school/upper secondary school education. If your documents are not in English or a
       Scandinavian language, you will have to provide an authorized translation. You should receive this form no later than June 1. If you have not received it by this date, contact NUCAS
       immediately, and no later than June 10. The omslagsark must be returned to NUCAS before July 1.

   Decisions dates and other deadlines
   Places are offered to students by July 20. This process assumes that the student either is currently residing in Norway, or is eligible for Norwegian residency. Students who live abroad and who
   want to apply using this process may find that the late notification date makes it difficult to obtain a student residency permit in a timely manner.

   Certain departments/programmes have different deadlines, so it is best to check the web sites for the programmes you are interested in.

   Application exceptions:

   Not all NTNU programmes use the NUCAS application process. A complete desciption of the programmes where the language of instruction is in Norwegian but where the application is made directly
   to NTNU can be found here. All require proficiency in Norwegian except for the international master's programme. In general, applications (in Norwegian) can be made directly to NTNU for:
     * Two-year master's programmes
     * Two-year international master's programme
     * Two-year master's programme in technology
     * Music performance
     * Psychology (professional degree)
     * Dance Studies
     * Teacher training, full-time (PPU)
     * Teacher training, part-time (FPPU)

   IMPORTANT TO NOTE

   March 1

   Degree students

How to apply

   Applying to NTNU to earn an undergraduate or ordinary master's degree is easy by using the centralized application processing centre called NUCAS, the Norwegian Universities and Colleges
   Admission Service (Samordnet opptak). Applications for international master's and PhD programmes are made directly to the university. Here's what you need to know.

   Illustrasjonsbilde/FOTO

   The deadline for foreign student applications is March 1, while for students with high school degrees from a Nordic country, the deadline is April 15. The online application form at NUCAS is
   available from February 1 of the year you wish to attend university, and can be used to apply for bachelor's and integrated master's degrees (a five year study programme which results in a
   master's, with no intermediate bachelor's degree), where the language of instruction is in Norwegian. In fact, all of NUCAS's important forms are in Norwegian, because if you don't understand
   Norwegian, you will need to use a different application procedure. A complete list (in Norwegian) of all of NTNU's programmes that use the NUCAS application form can be found here.

   Alternatives for non-Norwegian speakers
   If you want to study in Norway for an undergraduate degree but don't speak Norwegian, NTNU offers two different Norwegian language courses that will enable you to meet the language
   requirements.

   If you have the required undergraduate or graduate training but don't speak Norwegian, you can apply directly to NTNU for the following:
     * International master's degree programmes
     * PhD programmes

   Undergraduate and ordinary master's degree admissions process
   In general, admission to NTNU is highly competitive, particularly for engineering, architecture, and medicine. A strong grade average is an essential prerequisite to secure a place. Medicine,
   engineering and architecture also have special requirements in mathematics and physics.

   Applying to NTNU is a two-step process:
     * First, you need to fill out the NUCAS application form online (in Norwegian), which includes selecting the courses of study you wish to pursue, and the university/college where you want to
       study. You can choose as many as 10 different courses of study. A searchable list of courses and programmes is available here (only in Norwegian). The deadline for students educated outside
       of Scandinavia is March 1.
     * Then, when your application is registered, NUCAS will send you a form called an omslagsark (application file) in the post. This is where you provide information about your education, with
       relevant and officially certified copies of certificates, diplomas and transcripts from your high school/upper secondary school education. If your documents are not in English or a
       Scandinavian language, you will have to provide an authorized translation. You should receive this form no later than June 1. If you have not received it by this date, contact NUCAS
       immediately, and no later than June 10. The omslagsark must be returned to NUCAS before July 1.

   Decisions dates and other deadlines
   Places are offered to students by July 20. This process assumes that the student either is currently residing in Norway, or is eligible for Norwegian residency. Students who live abroad and who
   want to apply using this process may find that the late notification date makes it difficult to obtain a student residency permit in a timely manner.

   Certain departments/programmes have different deadlines, so it is best to check the web sites for the programmes you are interested in.

   Application exceptions:

   Not all NTNU programmes use the NUCAS application process. A complete desciption of the programmes where the language of instruction is in Norwegian but where the application is made directly
   to NTNU can be found here. All require proficiency in Norwegian except for the international master's programme. In general, applications (in Norwegian) can be made directly to NTNU for:
     * Two-year master's programmes
     * Two-year international master's programme
     * Two-year master's programme in technology
     * Music performance
     * Psychology (professional degree)
     * Dance Studies
     * Teacher training, full-time (PPU)
     * Teacher training, part-time (FPPU)

   IMPORTANT TO NOTE

   First application to NUCAS (for autumn semester) for foreign students:
   March 1

   First application to NUCAS (for autumn semester) for Norwegian/Nordic students:
   April 15

   Final deadlines spring / autumn:
   June 1 / November 15

   Preliminary Applications to:
   NUCAS

   Final application must be returned by:
   July 1

   Notification date:
   July 25

   Answers to questions about the final application process

   Please note: Due to the huge number of applicants, we simply cannot confirm the arrival of individual documents or applications. If you wish to be certain your documents have arrived you may
   send them via a company that offers a tracking system or via registered mail.

Questions about the preliminary application

   What is the deadline?
   The deadline to submit a preliminary application is 1 December.

   Should I send a hard copy of the preliminary application through the regular mail?
   No, do not send a hard copy of the application. Please just register online.

   Do I need to submit any documents with the preliminary application?
   No, please do not send any documents at this stage.

   I am having trouble with the online form, I think there is something wrong because I cannot submit my preliminary application.
   First of all, please make sure that all the required information in your form has been correctly entered  - pay special attention to the dates, which if filled in incorrectly will cause
   problems. Dates must be written DD.MM.YYYY to be accepted by the form, and be aware that dates such as 31.09.1985 and 29.02.2011 are not in the online calendar and will not be accepted.
   Mistakes like these can derail your entire application, so double check. If you are certain that you have filled in all of the necessary information correctly, please try again and/or try again
   from a different computer/computer line and/or on a different day, as it may be a local problem.

   In addition, please make sure that the 'Other relevant information'/'remarks' section does not contain more than 300 characters, as you will get an error message if this section contains more
   characters than this.

   We do receive many applications every day from all over the world, so we know that the online form works. Thus it should be possible to submit an application if you have filled out all the
   information correctly.

   When can I expect a reply?
   Those who make it through the preliminary selection process will be sent a final application form by email no later than 1 January 2012.

   Will I get an answer if I am rejected?
   Yes, you will get an answer by email even if you are not selected.

   Can I apply for more than one programme?
   No, you cannot.
   My institution is not on the list of NTNU's formal cooperation agreements for the Quota Scheme.
   If your institution is not on the list, NTNU does NOT have an agreement with your institution or the agreement has expired. To renew or initiate an agreement you need to contact your relevant
   department/faculty/school at your home institution. Formal cooperation agreements can only be initiated at an institutional level.


Admission and rejection letters
As a rule, admission letters will be sent by email and by regular post in early May. Rejection letters will be sent by email by the end of May.

   Please note that due to the huge number of applicants, we cannot respond individually to people who want to know the results of the admissions process before we send the acceptance and
   rejection letters. We regret this, and wish all applicants the best of luck.

   I have still not received admisison letter by post. What do I do about applying for visa/ residence permit?
   The electronically generated admissions letter sent to you by email is valid and can be submitted as proof of your acceptance when you apply for a student visa to Norway. Please apply for a
   visa as soon as possible using your email confirmation of admission. The visa process can be time consuming and it is best to initiate it as soon as you have the necessary paperwork, including
   the email admissions letter.


Deadlines: 1 December vs. 1 February

   Your website states that the deadline is 1 December (15 January for joint nordic Master's programmes), however some websites mention a deadline of 1 February. Can I apply using the 1 February
   deadline?
   The 1 February deadline is only for applicants who have applied through the preliminary application before 1 December and who have received a final application form. Regrettably, we cannot
   accept new applications for international master's programmes after the 1 December deadline.

   I registered an online application for one programme, and now I want to change to another programme. Can I do this after the deadline?
   No, that is not possible. You can only apply for one programme on the preliminary application, and this alternative cannot be changed after the deadline, so make your selections carefully.

English language requirements:

   Does NTNU accept the copy of the original TOEFL/IELTS reccord or I must ask TOEFL/IELTS institution to send the original record to NTNU?
   We will accept a certified copy of your TOEFL/IELTS test result.

   I have no problem with preparing and sending the required documents by the deadline except for the English language certification, what do I do?
   You can send us additional documentation for the English language certification up until 1 March.

   I have a bachelor's degree that was taught entirely in English, does this exempt me from the TOEFL/IELTS test?
   No, not unless you have a degree in English (i.e. majoring in English), or you are from one of the countries listed as exempted. For English requirements, please visit this webpage.
   Which IELTS test is required for admission to an international master's programme -- the academic or general test?
   Both academic and general test results will be accepted.

   Do you accept institutional TOEFL tests?
   No, we do not.
   What is NTNU's TOEFL Department Code?
   The department code is 9652.

Motivation, recommendation, portfolio and CV:

   Should I provide a motivation letter and CV?
   Yes, please submit a CV and motivation letter.

   Do I have to provide a recommendation letter and how many must I provide? Does NTNU use a specific form for recommendation letters?
   Please submit two letters of recommendation.There is no particular form to be filled out, a regular letter will serve just fine. Please send the recommendation letters along with your
   application/other documents.

   Is a portfolio necessary to apply for an architecture programme? Also, does it improve my chances of admission if I send a portfolio even if my application does not require it?
   A portfolio is not mandatory, but may be beneficial to your application when applying for a master's in architecture.

Passport and personal information:

   I understand that I must submit certified copies of some pages of my passport, but does NTNU accept a photocopy of the first page of original passport or must I go to the notary office to have
   all the copies notarized?
   All copies will need to be officially certified by a public institution (such as a university) or a Notary Public in order for your application to be considered. We require certified copies of
   the pages of your passport showing your photo, date of birth, full name, gender and nationality. If there is other information that you are uncertain about, get it notarized.


   I don't have a passport, and I cannot obtain one until I can show the passport office some documentation of a final acceptance to NTNU. Can I send to you a certified copy of my national card?
   Can I submit my documents without including a copy of my passport?
   Yes, a certified copy of a valid national ID card is acceptable if you do not yet have a passport.

   However, note that we cannot process your application unless we receive some form of official ID document, so you must supply either a passport or some other form of national ID card. Your
   application will not be considered unless this is submitted.

   Unfortunately, my personal data in the application form has been filled in incorrectly, can I change/correct it?
   Yes, you can.

Financing:

   I have a bank statement from my sponsor which is now 2 months old, is that acceptable for the application process?
   Yes, that is acceptable, as long as the statement is no older than 3 months.

   How do I provide documentation when I want to use a private sponsor? What if I am going to finance myself?
   You have to submit a letter from your sponsor, confirming that he/ she is indeed willing to be your sponsor, as well as a bank balance statement, showing that the sponsor has the required
   amount of money available. If you are going to finance yourself, you must submit a certified copy of your bank statement, showing that you have the required amount in your account.
   The financial requirement is NOK 90 800 per year, but the master's degree programme lasts for two years. Do I need to show that I have NOK 90 800 or NOK 181 600?
   You will only need to show that you have NOK 90 800. Please note, however, that you will only get a residence permit for one year, and this must be renewed. With your application for renewal,
   you will have to show documentation that you have access to 90 800,-. once again.

Transcripts, records, diplomas:

   It is difficult or a problem for me to send a certificate from my higher secondary school, must I send this document?
   Yes, sorry, we do require a certified copy of your secondary education certificates or diploma.

   The application requirements state that educational documents should be sent directly by the school, but at the moment, our school does not provide this service to students. Is it possible for
   me to send you all of the documents personally?
   We will only accept transcripts and diploma sent in a sealed envelope directly from your university.

   The deadline for submitting my bachelor's diploma is  1 February, however, I will not finish my degree until June. What should I do?
   Please submit the transcripts that you have, as well as a list of the courses that you are currently enrolled in. We also need a confirmation from your university that you are expected to
   graduate in the summer of 2011. Please note that the final Bachelor's diploma must be sent to NTNU as soon as you receive it.

   The CDGDC may need more than 20 working days to verify all my documents after they received original documents, however the deadline for submitting everything is 1 February? The verification
   may not arrive by the deadline, what should I do?
   Please include copies of your educational documents with your application package and submit this within the deadline so that we can start processing your application. Then submit your
   documents to the CDGDC for verification, and we will accept a verification report from them even after the deadline.

   Does the High School diploma also need to be verified through the national agency?
   No, it does not.

   My school is on Christmas vacation, and it will not be possible for them to send the transcripts within the deadline the 1st of February. What do I do?

   You can send us a certified copy of your transcripts/diploma along with your application package, and ask your university to send the transcripts once they are back. You will not be able to
   receive admission unless we receive the educational documents directly from your university

   My University can send my educational documents, but they are not in English. Can I send you the translations myself?
   Yes, please get the educational documents translated by an official translator and send this yourself. You should in addition ask your university to send the educational documents directly.

   I can send you the educational documents from my university; however my high school does not provide this service. Can I send these documents myself?
   Please include these in your application package and send them yourself.

   I'm an applicant from China. I should send my diploma and transcripts to CDGDC but I haven't graduated so I don't have a diploma. What should I do?
   Please include a copy of your transcript and a confirmation that you are expected to graduate in 2012 in your application package. Then send your transcript to CDGDC for verification. We will
   receive a verification report directly from CDGDC. Please also send us your final diploma as soon as you get it.

Other questions:

   I have been turned down for the final application, could you please help me in looking at my preliminary application and tell me what made me unqualified?
   As much as we would like to help, we do not have the capacity to provide individual counselling or check each individual applicant's form, due to the huge number of applications we receive
   every year. However, in most cases, the reason for the rejection is that the applicant's grades simply are not high enough to match the competition for the places we offer. You can read more
   about requirements for international master's programmes, but note that due to the limited number of seats, admission to NTNU is always very difficult. You can also post a query to students who
   have been accepted to NTNU on our Facebook page.

   Can you send me an email confirmation that you have received my documents?
   No, again, due to the huge number of applicants, we simply cannot confirm the arrival of individual documents. If you wish to be certain your documents have arrived you may send them via a
   company that offers a tracking system or via registered mail.

   May I bring my wife/ husband and children with me?
   For information regarding family immigration, please visit UDI's webpage. Please note that we only offer single rooms for admitted students. If you plan to bring your family you must arrange
   for accommodation on your own.

   Can I fill out the application electronically, or should I fill it out by hand?
   Both are ok, as long as you remember to sign the form that you submit.

Do I  have to get a notary office to certify all of my documents?
All copies will need to be officially certified in order for your application to be considered.

   What is NTNU's organization number?

   How can I arrange for a room at the student village?
   The Office of International Relations at NTNU will book a room for master's students who need a single room. Once you have returned the acknowledgement form and informed us that you need a
   single room, we will book a room for you. Please note: You will receive a contract by e-mail from the student village in June. Please check your e-mail every day in June to see if you have
   received the contract. All necessary information regarding accommodation will be included in the contract. Be aware that you have to pay a deposit (NOK 5000,-) and sign the contract, as stated
   in the contract you will receive, by the deadline.If you do not act in accordance with the contract, your booking will be cancelled and you must then find private accommodation in Trondheim. A
   room in Trondheim can be difficult to obtain and normally costs more than NOK 4000,- per month.

   programme coordinator, anette.moen@ntnu.no for Quota or oddrun.maao@ntnu.no for individual funding.

   I am having trouble transferring money from my home country, but the admission letter says the money must be transferred by the students themselves. Is it possible to have someone else transfer
   money for me?
   Yes, someone else can transfer this money for you; however, it needs to be clear from the transfer which student the transfer is intended for - the student's name will need to be clearly
   stated.

    How do I apply for a visa/ residence permit?
   Please see www.udi.no and apply as soon as you have received your admission letter by email.

Where can I find out more about what it is like to live in Trondheim and in Norway?

   You can find some fun information about Trondheim, or information about the more practical aspects of living in Trondheim and Norway on the International Researcher Support webpages. Although
   many of these pages are aimed at PhD candidates, much of the information may be relevant to master's students as well.

   Answers to questions about the final application process

   Please note: Due to the huge number of applicants, we simply cannot confirm the arrival of individual documents or applications. If you wish to be certain your documents have arrived you may
   send them via a company that offers a tracking system or via registered mail.

Questions about the preliminary application

   What is the deadline?
   The deadline to submit a preliminary application is 1 December.

   Should I send a hard copy of the preliminary application through the regular mail?
   No, do not send a hard copy of the application. Please just register online.

   Do I need to submit any documents with the preliminary application?
   No, please do not send any documents at this stage.

   I am having trouble with the online form, I think there is something wrong because I cannot submit my preliminary application.
   First of all, please make sure that all the required information in your form has been correctly entered  - pay special attention to the dates, which if filled in incorrectly will cause
   problems. Dates must be written DD.MM.YYYY to be accepted by the form, and be aware that dates such as 31.09.1985 and 29.02.2011 are not in the online calendar and will not be accepted.
   Mistakes like these can derail your entire application, so double check. If you are certain that you have filled in all of the necessary information correctly, please try again and/or try again
   from a different computer/computer line and/or on a different day, as it may be a local problem.

   In addition, please make sure that the 'Other relevant information'/'remarks' section does not contain more than 300 characters, as you will get an error message if this section contains more
   characters than this.

   We do receive many applications every day from all over the world, so we know that the online form works. Thus it should be possible to submit an application if you have filled out all the
   information correctly.

   When can I expect a reply?
   Those who make it through the preliminary selection process will be sent a final application form by email no later than 1 January 2012.

   Will I get an answer if I am rejected?
   Yes, you will get an answer by email even if you are not selected.

   Can I apply for more than one programme?
   No, you cannot.
   My institution is not on the list of NTNU's formal cooperation agreements for the Quota Scheme.
   If your institution is not on the list, NTNU does NOT have an agreement with your institution or the agreement has expired. To renew or initiate an agreement you need to contact your relevant
   department/faculty/school at your home institution. Formal cooperation agreements can only be initiated at an institutional level.


Admission and rejection letters
As a rule, admission letters will be sent by email and by regular post in early May. Rejection letters will be sent by email by the end of May.

   Please note that due to the huge number of applicants, we cannot respond individually to people who want to know the results of the admissions process before we send the acceptance and
   rejection letters. We regret this, and wish all applicants the best of luck.

   I have still not received admisison letter by post. What do I do about applying for visa/ residence permit?
   The electronically generated admissions letter sent to you by email is valid and can be submitted as proof of your acceptance when you apply for a student visa to Norway. Please apply for a
   visa as soon as possible using your email confirmation of admission. The visa process can be time consuming and it is best to initiate it as soon as you have the necessary paperwork, including
   the email admissions letter.


Deadlines: 1 December vs. 1 February

   Your website states that the deadline is 1 December (15 January for joint nordic Master's programmes), however some websites mention a deadline of 1 February. Can I apply using the 1 February
   deadline?
   The 1 February deadline is only for applicants who have applied through the preliminary application before 1 December and who have received a final application form. Regrettably, we cannot
   accept new applications for international master's programmes after the 1 December deadline.

   I registered an online application for one programme, and now I want to change to another programme. Can I do this after the deadline?
   No, that is not possible. You can only apply for one programme on the preliminary application, and this alternative cannot be changed after the deadline, so make your selections carefully.

English language requirements:

   Does NTNU accept the copy of the original TOEFL/IELTS reccord or I must ask TOEFL/IELTS institution to send the original record to NTNU?
   We will accept a certified copy of your TOEFL/IELTS test result.

   I have no problem with preparing and sending the required documents by the deadline except for the English language certification, what do I do?
   You can send us additional documentation for the English language certification up until 1 March.

   I have a bachelor's degree that was taught entirely in English, does this exempt me from the TOEFL/IELTS test?
   No, not unless you have a degree in English (i.e. majoring in English), or you are from one of the countries listed as exempted. For English requirements, please visit this webpage.
   Which IELTS test is required for admission to an international master's programme -- the academic or general test?
   Both academic and general test results will be accepted.

   Do you accept institutional TOEFL tests?
   No, we do not.
   What is NTNU's TOEFL Department Code?
   The department code is 9652.

Motivation, recommendation, portfolio and CV:

   Should I provide a motivation letter and CV?
   Yes, please submit a CV and motivation letter.

   Do I have to provide a recommendation letter and how many must I provide? Does NTNU use a specific form for recommendation letters?
   Please submit two letters of recommendation.There is no particular form to be filled out, a regular letter will serve just fine. Please send the recommendation letters along with your
   application/other documents.

   Is a portfolio necessary to apply for an architecture programme? Also, does it improve my chances of admission if I send a portfolio even if my application does not require it?
   A portfolio is not mandatory, but may be beneficial to your application when applying for a master's in architecture.

Passport and personal information:

   I understand that I must submit certified copies of some pages of my passport, but does NTNU accept a photocopy of the first page of original passport or must I go to the notary office to have
   all the copies notarized?
   All copies will need to be officially certified by a public institution (such as a university) or a Notary Public in order for your application to be considered. We require certified copies of
   the pages of your passport showing your photo, date of birth, full name, gender and nationality. If there is other information that you are uncertain about, get it notarized.


   I don't have a passport, and I cannot obtain one until I can show the passport office some documentation of a final acceptance to NTNU. Can I send to you a certified copy of my national card?
   Can I submit my documents without including a copy of my passport?
   Yes, a certified copy of a valid national ID card is acceptable if you do not yet have a passport.

   However, note that we cannot process your application unless we receive some form of official ID document, so you must supply either a passport or some other form of national ID card. Your
   application will not be considered unless this is submitted.

   Unfortunately, my personal data in the application form has been filled in incorrectly, can I change/correct it?
   Yes, you can.

Financing:

   I have a bank statement from my sponsor which is now 2 months old, is that acceptable for the application process?
   Yes, that is acceptable, as long as the statement is no older than 3 months.

   How do I provide documentation when I want to use a private sponsor? What if I am going to finance myself?
   You have to submit a letter from your sponsor, confirming that he/ she is indeed willing to be your sponsor, as well as a bank balance statement, showing that the sponsor has the required
   amount of money available. If you are going to finance yourself, you must submit a certified copy of your bank statement, showing that you have the required amount in your account.
   The financial requirement is NOK 90 800 per year, but the master's degree programme lasts for two years. Do I need to show that I have NOK 90 800 or NOK 181 600?
   You will only need to show that you have NOK 90 800. Please note, however, that you will only get a residence permit for one year, and this must be renewed. With your application for renewal,
   you will have to show documentation that you have access to 90 800,-. once again.

Transcripts, records, diplomas:

   It is difficult or a problem for me to send a certificate from my higher secondary school, must I send this document?
   Yes, sorry, we do require a certified copy of your secondary education certificates or diploma.

   The application requirements state that educational documents should be sent directly by the school, but at the moment, our school does not provide this service to students. Is it possible for
   me to send you all of the documents personally?
   We will only accept transcripts and diploma sent in a sealed envelope directly from your university.

   The deadline for submitting my bachelor's diploma is  1 February, however, I will not finish my degree until June. What should I do?
   Please submit the transcripts that you have, as well as a list of the courses that you are currently enrolled in. We also need a confirmation from your university that you are expected to
   graduate in the summer of 2011. Please note that the final Bachelor's diploma must be sent to NTNU as soon as you receive it.

   The CDGDC may need more than 20 working days to verify all my documents after they received original documents, however the deadline for submitting everything is 1 February? The verification
   may not arrive by the deadline, what should I do?
   Please include copies of your educational documents with your application package and submit this within the deadline so that we can start processing your application. Then submit your
   documents to the CDGDC for verification, and we will accept a verification report from them even after the deadline.

   Does the High School diploma also need to be verified through the national agency?
   No, it does not.

   My school is on Christmas vacation, and it will not be possible for them to send the transcripts within the deadline the 1st of February. What do I do?

   You can send us a certified copy of your transcripts/diploma along with your application package, and ask your university to send the transcripts once they are back. You will not be able to
   receive admission unless we receive the educational documents directly from your university

   My University can send my educational documents, but they are not in English. Can I send you the translations myself?
   Yes, please get the educational documents translated by an official translator and send this yourself. You should in addition ask your university to send the educational documents directly.

   I can send you the educational documents from my university; however my high school does not provide this service. Can I send these documents myself?
   Please include these in your application package and send them yourself.

   I'm an applicant from China. I should send my diploma and transcripts to CDGDC but I haven't graduated so I don't have a diploma. What should I do?
   Please include a copy of your transcript and a confirmation that you are expected to graduate in 2012 in your application package. Then send your transcript to CDGDC for verification. We will
   receive a verification report directly from CDGDC. Please also send us your final diploma as soon as you get it.

Other questions:

   I have been turned down for the final application, could you please help me in looking at my preliminary application and tell me what made me unqualified?
   As much as we would like to help, we do not have the capacity to provide individual counselling or check each individual applicant's form, due to the huge number of applications we receive
   every year. However, in most cases, the reason for the rejection is that the applicant's grades simply are not high enough to match the competition for the places we offer. You can read more
   about requirements for international master's programmes, but note that due to the limited number of seats, admission to NTNU is always very difficult. You can also post a query to students who
   have been accepted to NTNU on our Facebook page.

   Can you send me an email confirmation that you have received my documents?
   No, again, due to the huge number of applicants, we simply cannot confirm the arrival of individual documents. If you wish to be certain your documents have arrived you may send them via a
   company that offers a tracking system or via registered mail.

   May I bring my wife/ husband and children with me?
   For information regarding family immigration, please visit UDI's webpage. Please note that we only offer single rooms for admitted students. If you plan to bring your family you must arrange
   for accommodation on your own.

   Can I fill out the application electronically, or should I fill it out by hand?
   Both are ok, as long as you remember to sign the form that you submit.

Do I  have to get a notary office to certify all of my documents?
All copies will need to be officially certified in order for your application to be considered.

   NTNU's organization number is: 974767880

Housing for international master students

   The Office of International Relations at NTNU is responsible for allocating accommodation for international students. International students cannot book a room themselves at the Students
   Welfare Organization, SiT (Studentsamskipnaden i Trondheim). All new international master students who have been accepted will receive information about housing from the Office of International
   Relations after they have been accepted at NTNU.

   International master students accepted at NTNU, will automatically be considered for housing in a single room (unless the student specifies to us that he will arrange for housing on his own).
   International students should not, under any circumstances, contact SiT about housing before receiving a housing contract directly from SiT
   The Students Welfare Organization, SiT is a non-profit organization led by the students through their majority in the board. 30% of the rooms in the student villages will be allocated to
   international students. NTNU has to relate to this rule and we must therefore prioritize who will get student housing.
   Priority will be given to new international master students.
   Please see the following webpage for important information for students allocated a room at the student village:
   http://www.ntnu.edu/studies/for-students-allocated-housing-at-the-student-village-sit

   International master students who decline the offer of housing, arrange for private accommodation or move out of SiT's student village into a private room  etc. cannot expect to be allocated
   housing again at SiT. SiT has a rule that students cannot move in again at the same student village and same type of room until at least 6 months after they move out. We will also give priority
   to new students, which means that students already living in Trondheim will not be prioritized.
   Students who have to find private housing may find more information here: http://www.ntnu.edu/studies/searching-for-private-housing
   Students going for a whole exchange semester abroad
   If you are an international master student living at the student village and will go abroad for an entire exchange semester you should do the following:
   - contact housing@adm.ntnu.no and inform us how long you are planning to be gone from NTNU
   - After this: cancel your housing contract with SiT. Remember that you have to give one months' notice. After your contract is cancelled, your housing deposit will be transferred back to your
   account.
   - Please inform the Office of International Relations to book a new room for you by contacting housing@adm.ntnu.no. If you plan on coming back to NTNU in the spring semester, contact us by
   sending us an e-mail in November. If you come back in the fall semester, please send us an e-mail in June.

   Please note that students going for field work for a few months should not cancel their room at the student village. Only students who will be away for a whole semester may cancel their room
   and move back in again at another room at the student village.
   Students who want to prolong their housing contract
   The Office of International Relations is responsible for contacting SiT about extension of housing contracts for international students. Please do not contact SiT directly about this.

   Due to the difficult housing situation for students in Trondheim, and the fact that new students arriving in August are prioritized, we will not be able to offer accommodation at the student
   village for fall 2012. This means that if you are delayed in your studies and require an extension of your study right, you will have to find private accommodation. Please contact
   housing@adm.ntnu.no before April 1^st if your contract expires in the end of June and you have to prolong your contract.

   In case an extension of your housing contract is approved you are unfortunately not guaranteed to keep the same room/apartment for your extension period.

   Please also present a confirmation from your supervisor regarding the extension of your studies if your studies will be extended longer than July 30th. Give the confirmation to the program
   coordinator (Oddrun Maaø oddrun.maao@ntnu.no for self financed student and Anette Moen anette.moen@ntnu.no for Quota students )
   Once the fall semster starts we have a lot of new students arriving and we cannot prolong your contract after this date unless you are delayed because of medical reasons.

   If you are delayed because of medical reasons, we will in each case consider whether we can extend your accommodation if we receive confirmation from your doctor.

   The Office of International Relations at NTNU is responsible for allocating accommodation for international students. International students cannot book a room themselves at the Students
   Welfare Organization, SiT (Studentsamskipnaden i Trondheim). All new international master students who have been accepted will receive information about housing from the Office of International
   Relations after they have been accepted at NTNU.

   International master students accepted at NTNU, will automatically be considered for housing in a single room (unless the student specifies to us that he will arrange for housing on his own).
   International students should not, under any circumstances, contact SiT about housing before receiving a housing contract directly from SiT
   The Students Welfare Organization, SiT is a non-profit organization led by the students through their majority in the board. 30% of the rooms in the student villages will be allocated to
   international students. NTNU has to relate to this rule and we must therefore prioritize who will get student housing.
   Priority will be given to new international master students.
   Please see the following webpage for important information for students allocated a room at the student village:
   http://www.ntnu.edu/studies/for-students-allocated-housing-at-the-student-village-sit

   International master students who decline the offer of housing, arrange for private accommodation or move out of SiT's student village into a private room  etc. cannot expect to be allocated
   housing again at SiT. SiT has a rule that students cannot move in again at the same student village and same type of room until at least 6 months after they move out. We will also give priority
   to new students, which means that students already living in Trondheim will not be prioritized.
   Students who have to find private housing may find more information here: http://www.ntnu.edu/studies/searching-for-private-housing
   Students going for a whole exchange semester abroad
   If you are an international master student living at the student village and will go abroad for an entire exchange semester you should do the following:
   - contact housing@adm.ntnu.no and inform us how long you are planning to be gone from NTNU
   - After this: cancel your housing contract with SiT. Remember that you have to give one months' notice. After your contract is cancelled, your housing deposit will be transferred back to your
   account.
   - Please inform the Office of International Relations to book a new room for you by contacting housing@adm.ntnu.no. If you plan on coming back to NTNU in the spring semester, contact us by
   sending us an e-mail in November. If you come back in the fall semester, please send us an e-mail in June.

   Please note that students going for field work for a few months should not cancel their room at the student village. Only students who will be away for a whole semester may cancel their room
   and move back in again at another room at the student village.
   Students who want to prolong their housing contract
   The Office of International Relations is responsible for contacting SiT about extension of housing contracts for international students. Please do not contact SiT directly about this.

   Due to the difficult housing situation for students in Trondheim, and the fact that new students arriving in August are prioritized, we will not be able to offer accommodation at the student
   village for fall 2012. This means that if you are delayed in your studies and require an extension of your study right, you will have to find private accommodation. Please contact
   housing@adm.ntnu.no before April 1^st if your contract expires in the end of June and you have to prolong your contract.

   In case an extension of your housing contract is approved you are unfortunately not guaranteed to keep the same room/apartment for your extension period.

   Please also present a confirmation from your supervisor regarding the extension of your studies if your studies will be extended longer than July 30th. Give the confirmation to the program
   coordinator (Oddrun Maaø oddrun.maao@ntnu.no for self financed student and Anette Moen anette.moen@ntnu.no for Quota students )
   Once the fall semster starts we have a lot of new students arriving and we cannot prolong your contract after this date unless you are delayed because of medical reasons.

   If you are delayed because of medical reasons, we will in each case consider whether we can extend your accommodation if we receive confirmation from your doctor.

Family and couples apartment at the student village(SiT)

   Please note that you should under no circumstances consider bringing your family with you at the time of your arrival in Trondheim. It is strictly forbidden to have another person living in
   your single room at the student village, and this also applies to children of any age.

   There is normally quite a long waiting list for family and couples accommodation in the student village. We recommend all students who want to apply for a family reunion to contact the Office
   of International Relations for important information regarding this after their arrival in Trondheim.
   There is normally quite a long waiting list for family and couples accommodation in the student village, this subject to availability (per August 2011 it takes approximately up to 4-5 months to
   get the desired accommodation. However it may even take some months longer). Students who already live at the student village may apply for family/couples housing at the student village at:
   http://www.unieiendom.no/sit/
   Please note: Students who are not holding a room at the student village and are living privately in Trondheim, must apply through the Office of International Relations for family housing at the
   student village. Please contact housing@adm.ntnu.no

   For family apartments: You need to give documentation of your child/ren/ or pregnancy. The name of spouse must also be given at the time of applying. Applicants with children will be given
   priority on the waiting list.
   For couples apartment:  The name of the spouse must be given at the time of applying. If you are willing to share kitchen and bath room with 2-3 other couples it may be easier finding an
   apartment. Please inform us if you may share kitchen/bathroom with other couples.
   Note: Students applying for family or couples apartments are responsible for updating their application with SiT every second month.

   At the time of applying for family housing you should either write a comment in the application form that your family is waiting for visa or contact the reception at Moholt after registering
   your application.  This in order to avoid that you get an offer for a family apartment and your family's visa for family reunification is still under processing.

   You should note that it is strictly forbidden to bring your family into your single room/shared kitchen accommodation. If you do so, you will lose the right to stay in the Student Village.

    It should also be mentioned that the private market for accommodation is very expensive in Trondheim.

   Joint Nordic Master's Programmes are two-year programmes that give students the opportunity to study at two different partner universities in the Nordic countries.
   Students will be able to choose between a number of universities for each MSc programme, which provides a unique possibility to tailor a degree by academic interest and area of specialization.
   Graduates will receive a joint or double degree at the completion of the programme. The language of instruction is English.

Financing, fees and scholarships

Fees

   You will be paying fees and charges directly to the university where you are enrolled. The fees will correspond to the fee level of that university. Please note that there are no tuition fees
   at NTNU. For more information about the other universities, please check their websites.

Documentation of funding

   While there are no fees at NTNU, regulations from the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration state that all international students who are not citizens of EU/EEA/EFTA countries need to apply for
   a student residence permit (www.udi.no). This means that applicants for programmes at NTNU must document their funding source(s) (NOK 92,500 for 2012/2013) in their application.

How to provide documentation

   In your application for admission, you may document financing by means of a bank statement and a letter of confirmation from your sponsor, but The Norwegian Directorate of Immigration will only
   accept confirmation of scholarships, grants or bank guarantees from a Norwegian bank.
   Students who are admitted to a master's programme will be requested to transfer NOK 92,500 (2012/2013) to NTNU's deposit account before their arrival in Norway. This deposit is for covering
   living expenses only (NTNU does not have tuition fees). The money will be transferred to the student's Norwegian bank account once the student has opened one. Information about how to transfer
   the money to NTNU's deposit account will be provided along with the admissions letter.

Scholarships

   There are unfortunately no scholarships available to Joint Nordic Master's Programme students at NTNU. However, some of the partner universities have a limited number of tuition fee waivers to
   award foreign students. Please look at the other universities' homepages for information.

Exchange students

   Illustrasjonsbilde/FOTO

    Want to study abroad? NTNU has nearly 300 different cooperative or exchange agreements with institutions in 58 countries, from Albania to Zimbabwe. The university also participates in numerous
   student exchange and placement programmes, such as the Erasmus programme and the Leonardo da Vinci programme. Others are operated in conjunction with other Nordic countries (NORDPLUS).

   Exchange students who come to NTNU from abroad typically attend the university for short periods of between 3-12 months and return to their home university at the end of the exchange period.

   If your university does not have a formal exchange agreement with NTNU, you may apply to study at NTNU for a maximum of one academic year as a Free Mover.

   If you're an NTNU student who wants to study abroad, contact the Office of International Relations. If you're an exchange student from abroad who is thinking about attending or is actually here

Exchange students

   Illustrasjonsbilde/FOTO

    Want to study abroad? NTNU has nearly 300 different cooperative or exchange agreements with institutions in 58 countries, from Albania to Zimbabwe. The university also participates in numerous
   student exchange and placement programmes, such as the Erasmus programme and the Leonardo da Vinci programme. Others are operated in conjunction with other Nordic countries (NORDPLUS).

   Exchange students who come to NTNU from abroad typically attend the university for short periods of between 3-12 months and return to their home university at the end of the exchange period.

   If your university does not have a formal exchange agreement with NTNU, you may apply to study at NTNU for a maximum of one academic year as a Free Mover.

   If you're an NTNU student who wants to study abroad, contact the Office of International Relations. If you're an exchange student from abroad who is thinking about attending or is actually here

   Exchange students

Admission requirements

- Office of International Relations

   If you want to come to NTNU for a period of between 3 and 12 months as an exchange student, NTNU considers you to be enrolled at your home university.

   Illustrasjonsbilde/FOTO

   This means that one of NTNU's primary admission requirements -- that you be proficient in Norwegian -- does not apply. Instead, you can simply apply to attend NTNU as an exchange student.

   The normal language of instruction at NTNU for undergraduate and many master's degree programmes is Norwegian, although a number of courses are taught in English. Exams can always be arranged
   in English and in the majority of cases, textbooks are in English or alternative titles in English will be recommended. Project work can always be supervised in English.

   If you're interested in learning Norwegian, NTNU offers an intensive summer course as well as Norwegian classes offered throughout the semester.

Step-by-Step Survival Guide

   Remember NTNU offers a wide range of courses taught in English from which visiting and exchange students can choose. The list includes courses from all faculties and covers a broad spectrum of
   disciplines. Use the links under "COURSE INFORMATION" to find out more.

1. Make a list of your courses

   WHICH COURSES? Make a list of the course codes for courses you listed on your application and which you were approved for.
   For example:
   TDT4230 Visualization
   POL1003 Environmental Politics
     * EU (European Union) exchange students who do not remember which courses they registered for may check their original application on-line . See the link on the the bottom of the page with
       the heading STATUS OF YOUR APPLICATION, ie: Your study programme- click here.
     * Exchange students/free-movers from outside the EU who do not remember which courses they registered for should contact the Office of International Relations . (Please check the information
       previously sent to you first. You should have a list.)
     * If you want to take a course for which you were not previously approved there are two ways to obtain approval. The way you do it depends on whether or not the course is restricted admission
       or open admission.
       Restricted admission: Contact the department/faculty for approval and have them sign the restricted course approval form. A list of contacts is provided HERE(.pdf).
       NOTE: A list of courses which are restricted admission is provided HERE . You'll find a link to the overview over restricted admission courses on the right hand side of the web page, ie
       "Oversikt over adgangsbegrensede emner". Unfortunately this list is only available in Norwegian, but the course numbers are easy to understand so you can at least see if the course you have
       selected is restricted admission.
       Please click HERE for the approval form you will need to have signed by the faculty.
       Open admission: check to see that you have the prerequisites (academic background) for the course(s) you would like to add to your program and then register for the course using STUDWEB
       (see below).

   Course information:
     * The on-line catalog provides an English description of the courses being offered at NTNU. (Notice search options to the left!). Check the box "Show only courses offered in English" for
       courses offered in English.
     * The Norwegian on-line catalogs provide the most up-to-date information of what is offered. You will find the Norwegian catalogues quite useful even if you don't know a word of Norwegian.
     * If you are taking courses on graduate level you might also be interested in checking the catalog for the International Master's programs . Click HERE for the catalog.
     * Hard copies of the catalogues are available in the Main Library or International House (but they may not be taken home). They can also be purchased from the university bookstore run by SiT
       .


2. Check that you have the correct course code

   CORRECT COURSE CODE? Course codes sometimes change. To check if you have the correct code you should first check the English on-line catalog . If you don't find what you need there then check
   the Norwegian course catalogs. If you are having trouble, please ask at the faculty office or the Office of International Relations .

3. Find when and where the course is

   WHEN? To find out when and where the course is given (lecture times and location) please see the  course schedule (TIMEPLAN). The list is alphabetical by course code. Click on the course code
   for information on the time and place the course will be taught and who is teaching it.

   In some cases it may say:"Spørsmål om undervisning og timeplan rettes til instituttet som gir undervisning i emnet." Basically this means if you have questions about the course or the schedule
   go to the department offering the course and ask.

   In order to understand the course schedule (TIMEPLAN), you will need to know a few Norwegian terms:

   NORWEGIAN

   ENGLISH

   Timeplan

   Course schedule

   Tid

   Time

   Uke

   Week (These are the weeks the course is given.) Example 2-11, 13-18: means that lectures are given weeks 2-11, no lectures week 12, lectures weeks 13-18

   Sted

   Place

Step-by-Step Survival Guide

   Remember NTNU offers a wide range of courses taught in English from which visiting and exchange students can choose. The list includes courses from all faculties and covers a broad spectrum of
   disciplines. Use the links under "COURSE INFORMATION" to find out more.

1. Make a list of your courses

   WHICH COURSES? Make a list of the course codes for courses you listed on your application and which you were approved for.
   For example:
   TDT4230 Visualization
   POL1003 Environmental Politics
     * EU (European Union) exchange students who do not remember which courses they registered for may check their original application on-line . See the link on the the bottom of the page with
       the heading STATUS OF YOUR APPLICATION, ie: Your study programme- click here.
     * Exchange students/free-movers from outside the EU who do not remember which courses they registered for should contact the Office of International Relations . (Please check the information
       previously sent to you first. You should have a list.)
     * If you want to take a course for which you were not previously approved there are two ways to obtain approval. The way you do it depends on whether or not the course is restricted admission
       or open admission.
       Restricted admission: Contact the department/faculty for approval and have them sign the restricted course approval form. A list of contacts is provided HERE(.pdf).
       NOTE: A list of courses which are restricted admission is provided HERE . You'll find a link to the overview over restricted admission courses on the right hand side of the web page, ie
       "Oversikt over adgangsbegrensede emner". Unfortunately this list is only available in Norwegian, but the course numbers are easy to understand so you can at least see if the course you have
       selected is restricted admission.
       Please click HERE for the approval form you will need to have signed by the faculty.
       Open admission: check to see that you have the prerequisites (academic background) for the course(s) you would like to add to your program and then register for the course using STUDWEB
       (see below).

   Course information:
     * The on-line catalog provides an English description of the courses being offered at NTNU. (Notice search options to the left!). Check the box "Show only courses offered in English" for
       courses offered in English.
     * The Norwegian on-line catalogs provide the most up-to-date information of what is offered. You will find the Norwegian catalogues quite useful even if you don't know a word of Norwegian.
     * If you are taking courses on graduate level you might also be interested in checking the catalog for the International Master's programs . Click HERE for the catalog.
     * Hard copies of the catalogues are available in the Main Library or International House (but they may not be taken home). They can also be purchased from the university bookstore run by SiT
       .


2. Check that you have the correct course code

   CORRECT COURSE CODE? Course codes sometimes change. To check if you have the correct code you should first check the English on-line catalog . If you don't find what you need there then check
   the Norwegian course catalogs. If you are having trouble, please ask at the faculty office or the Office of International Relations .

3. Find when and where the course is

   WHEN? To find out when and where the course is given (lecture times and location) please see the  course schedule (TIMEPLAN). The list is alphabetical by course code. Click on the course code
   for information on the time and place the course will be taught and who is teaching it.

   In some cases it may say:"Spørsmål om undervisning og timeplan rettes til instituttet som gir undervisning i emnet." Basically this means if you have questions about the course or the schedule
   go to the department offering the course and ask.

   In order to understand the course schedule (TIMEPLAN), you will need to know a few Norwegian terms:

   NORWEGIAN

   ENGLISH

   Timeplan

   Course schedule

   Tid

   Time

   Uke

Registering for courses

   All students must register for the courses they are going to attend. Registering for a course will give you access to the course information, assignments etc. available through It's Learning,

   Please keep in mind:
     * You should not register for more than 30 ECTS credits per semester.
     * You must register for courses before you register for the exams.



Registering for exams


   After registering for a course, you must register for the exams in that course.

   Please remember to:
     * register for courses even if there is no written examination.
     * check the exam schedule to make sure that the courses you register for do not have an exam on the same day.
     * check the course schedule to avoid selecting courses that are taught at the same time.

   Please note that registering for courses and exams is compulsory, even if you have been pre-approved for your courses before arriving in Trondheim.



Procedures


   You can register for courses and exams in all courses that you have been preapproved for. If, however, you have to change your plan of study, please follow this procedure:

   1. Check that you fulfill the requirements for the given course.
   It is YOUR responsibility to check that you have the necessary academic background for the courses you register for. Before registering a course that you have not been preapproved for, read the
   information about the prerequisites (required previous knowledge) for that course. This information is available on: http://www.ntnu.no/studies/courses

   If you are in doubt as to whether or not you fulfill the requirements, or if you need advice, please check the list for contact persons at the Faculties/Departments (UPDATED LIST WILL BE
   AVAILABLE SOON!). These contact persons can assist you if you have questions regarding your academic qualifications.

   LIST OF CONTACT PERSONS - Click HERE (pdf).

   2. If you have all the necessary prerequisites then log on to Studentweb and register for the exam.



Restricted admission


   NOTE: In some cases, registration for a course/exam is not possible due to the fact that some courses have restricted admission. If you are unable to register for a course due to restricted
   admission, please contact the Office of International Relations for assistance.
     * Courses with restricted admission

   When registering for courses that you have been preapproved for you may experience that you are unable to register due to restricted admission. In order to have these courses registered, you
   must hand in the form "Approval of additional courses with restricted admission"

   Instructions for filling in the form:
     * If you have been preapproved for a restricted admission course, the approval/signature from the Faculty is not needed, only the course code and course title.
     * If you have not been preapproved, but you wish to add a restricted admission course to your plan of study, the Faculty or Department in charge of the course must approve your taking the
       course (ie sign the form). In order to get the signatures you need, please contact the departmental/faculty contact .
     * After you have completed the form bring the form to the Office of International Relations so that we can register you for the restricted admission classes and exams listed on the form.

   NOTE: If you are NOT registering for any restricted admission courses you do NOT need to submit the restricted course admission approval form.

     * You must register for courses before you register for the exams.



Registering for exams


   After registering for a course, you must register for the exams in that course.

   Please remember to:
     * register for courses even if there is no written examination.
     * check the exam schedule to make sure that the courses you register for do not have an exam on the same day.
     * check the course schedule to avoid selecting courses that are taught at the same time.

   Please note that registering for courses and exams is compulsory, even if you have been pre-approved for your courses before arriving in Trondheim.



Procedures


   You can register for courses and exams in all courses that you have been preapproved for. If, however, you have to change your plan of study, please follow this procedure:

   1. Check that you fulfill the requirements for the given course.
   It is YOUR responsibility to check that you have the necessary academic background for the courses you register for. Before registering a course that you have not been preapproved for, read the
   information about the prerequisites (required previous knowledge) for that course. This information is available on: http://www.ntnu.no/studies/courses

   If you are in doubt as to whether or not you fulfill the requirements, or if you need advice, please check the list for contact persons at the Faculties/Departments (UPDATED LIST WILL BE
   AVAILABLE SOON!). These contact persons can assist you if you have questions regarding your academic qualifications.

   LIST OF CONTACT PERSONS - Click HERE (pdf).

   2. If you have all the necessary prerequisites then log on to Studentweb and register for the exam.



Restricted admission


   NOTE: In some cases, registration for a course/exam is not possible due to the fact that some courses have restricted admission. If you are unable to register for a course due to restricted
   admission, please contact the Office of International Relations for assistance.
     * Courses with restricted admission

   When registering for courses that you have been preapproved for you may experience that you are unable to register due to restricted admission. In order to have these courses registered, you
   must hand in the form "Approval of additional courses with restricted admission"

   Instructions for filling in the form:
     * If you have been preapproved for a restricted admission course, the approval/signature from the Faculty is not needed, only the course code and course title.
     * If you have not been preapproved, but you wish to add a restricted admission course to your plan of study, the Faculty or Department in charge of the course must approve your taking the
       course (ie sign the form). In order to get the signatures you need, please contact the departmental/faculty contact .
     * After you have completed the form bring the form to the Office of International Relations so that we can register you for the restricted admission classes and exams listed on the form.

   NOTE: If you are NOT registering for any restricted admission courses you do NOT need to submit the restricted course admission approval form.



Exam results and transcripts of records


     * You may view your exam results and order copies of your transcript of grades using the Studentweb . Click "status" and then "view exam results" to see the exams that have been graded at
       NTNU.
     * Click "orders" and then "examination transcripts" to have a transcript sent to your address as soon as the results are available. There is no charge for this service. Please note that most
       exam results are available sometime in January for the fall exams and sometime in July for the spring exams.
       Remember that if your home address has changed since you submitted your application to NTNU you will need to tell the Office of International Relations your new address so that we can
       update the information. Please email us: international@adm.ntnu.no and write ADDRESS CHANGE in the subject line of the email.

Housing

   Please be aware that the information in this webpage can change, so check back often for updates.

   The Office of International Relations at NTNU is responsible for allocating accommodation for international students. All international students who have applied for an exchange period at NTNU
   will receive information about housing from the Office of International Relations before their arrival.
   Once you applied for an exchange period at NTNU before the deadline, you automatically applied for housing (unless you specified in the form that you will arrange for housing on your own). You
   should not, under any circumstances, contact SiT about housing before you have received information from The Office of International Relations.

   Unfortunately, NTNU cannot guarantee housing for all incoming exchange students. Accepted exchange students from countries outside of the EU/EEA are guaranteed housing due to visa regulations.
   All students who have applied for studies at NTNU in the fall semester will be informed about housing in time before their arrival (second half of June).

   Students who have applied within the deadline ( May 1^st for the fall semester / October 1^st for the spring semester) and have been accepted, will be prioritized for housing. This does not
   mean, however, that you are guaranteed housing. If you for some reason applied after the deadline you will therefore not be prioritized for housing since students who applied before the
   deadline will be first in line when the rooms are being allocated. This means that if there are vacant rooms at the student village after we have allocated available rooms we may however give
   you a room. But be aware that this is not very likely.
   Due to the fact that we have a lot of exchange students at NTNU and not enough rooms available at the student villages, the Office of International Relations cannot allocate housing for PhD's.
   However, PhD's from the Quota programme and HEC-students financed by SiU are exempted from this rule. Otherwise, though, in general if you are a PhD student, you are considered an NTNU
   employee, and there are different programmes to help you with housing which you can read about here.
   The Students Welfare Organization, SiT, is a non-profit organization led by the students through their majority in the board. The rules require that up to 30% of the rooms in the student
   villages are allocated to international students, but not more. NTNU has to adhere to this rule and so has to prioritize who will get student housing.
   Priority will be given to students coming from partner universities where NTNU has an exchange agreement (this does not mean however that all students from partner institutions will be
   allocated housing). We will also give the priority a certain geographical profile.
   Students who are not provided housing by SiT has to find private housing on their own. (It is usually easier to find housing in the spring semester, both at the student village and in
   Trondheim's private housing market.)
   Students who have to find private housing may find more information in this webpage http://www.ntnu.edu/studies/searching-for-private-housing

   Students who are lucky and are allocated housing at SiT or Persaunet by the Office of International Relations will find important information on these webpages.

Searching for private housing

   Students who are not allocated housing at SiT will have to find private accommodation on their own. The Office of International Relations has information about all students that are not
   allocated housing and it is not necessary to contact us about this.

   Finding a place to live in Trondheim can be a challenge, especially for students who want to live close to NTNU and/or the center of Trondheim. Rooms close to NTNU are popular and more
   expensive than rooms located in the suburbs (for example suburbs like Ranheim, Vikåsen, Kolstad, Tiller and Heimdal) and we therefore advise students to look for private accommodation in the
   suburbs. Rooms close to NTNU / the centre of Trondheim cost from approximately NOK 4500,- per month. Electricity is usually not included in the monthly rent. This means that if you find
   something around this price you should accept it.
   Experience has shown that it is easier to find housing in the spring, both in the student villages and in the private market in Trondheim and it might therefore be an idea to consider coming to
   NTNU in the spring rather than the fall semester if possible. For information about vacant rooms/apartments please visit these web pages:

   www.Innsida.ntnu.no
   www.finn.no
   www.hybel.no
   www.easyroommate.com

   If you need general information about the private housing market in Trondheim, you may contact the Housing assistance: http://www.velferdstinget.no/2012/boligassistanse/ or the Office of
   International Relations at this address: housing@adm.ntnu.no.

   FAQ

   1) What should I do?
   The most important thing is to call or send a SMS to the owner of the appartement you find. They receive a lot of emails, so your chances are much higher if you call. Second, you should put in
   your own ad, at least in www.hybel.no that is free :)

   2) What do I have to pay
   Close to the campus you should be happy if you find something around 4300 NOK, I know this is expensive, but that is the reality. A Little further away (15 min with bus) you should be able to
   find something for around 3300 NOK.

   3) What is best, one person or a group
   It is allmost allways best to be a group, then the houseowner can keep in touch with one of you and less work for him/her

   4) What do the Office of International relations do to help
    1. We have contacted over 4000 NTNU Alumni about the housing situation and our hope is that some of them have a vacant room for you.
    2. We work with the housing assistance
    3. We try to find big appartements houses in town which we can offer you

   5 How many students arrive each year and how many receive housing
   We expect that around 1300 international students will come in August and we only have housing for around 925, first all the students from outside EU/EØS receive housing because they need it to
   enter the Country. After that there is around 325 left for the 700 students from EU/EØS. Most of that is given to the students who are attending the Language couse, but some are left to you.
   And I expect that maybe as many as 100 of the students who have allready received housing will cancel it, so there is still a small hope

   For students arriving in the fall semester:
   Students arriving in Trondheim in the fall semester are guaranteed to have a bed available for a short period at "Roof Over Your Head". This offer opens August 11th and is for students who are
   not allocated a room at SiT and must find private housing on their own. Please see the following website for further information (the webpage will be updated during spring/summer):
   http://www.studiebyen.no/en/housing-assistance/roof-over-your-head


   If you arrive before August 11th, you may arrange for temporary housing at Trondheim Interrail Center.
   Due to a huge conferance in week 33 it will be very difficult to get a room at any hotel in Trondheim during this week.
   Please inform the Office of International Relations at housing@adm.ntnu.no once you manage to find a room in the private market.

For students allocated housing at the student village, SiT

   The information in this webpage only concerns students who are informed that they are allocated housing at the student village, SiT.

   Unfortunately it is not possible to take into account special wishes from students concerning the location of the housing, who you want to live with etc. It is not possible to obtain a family
   or couple apartment at SiT. However, after you have moved in at your single room, you may apply internally to SiT for another room or apartment.
   Please note: You must under no circumstances apply for a new room before you have arrived and moved in at your original allocated room . This means that you must accept the original offer as
   stated in the contract (pay the deposit and signing the contract). Be also aware that there is no guarantee that you will be allocated another room and that getting the room of your wish might
   take several months to obtain. You might find relevant information regarding family/couples apartments at this webpage

   Students who get a room at SiT will receive a contract which will be sent to you by e-mail. All necessary information regarding accommodation will be included in the contract.
   Accepted students for spring 2012 who are allocated housing at SiT will in most cases, unless you have previously informed us that you would like an earlier starting date of your housing
   contract, get a room from around January 2. The room may be available some days later than this. You will have to pay rent from the starting date in the contract. If your arrival is later than
   the starting date you still need to pay rent from this date on.

   Please note: In order to reserve your room in the student village, SiT need you to pay a deposit of NOK 5000, - to SiT's account as stated in the contract (the deposit will be payed back to
   your account after you have moved out unless you have not followed SiT's rules). After you have received the contract you must transfer the deposit and fax or e-mail the receipt of the deposit,
   sign the contract and return this to SiT within the deadline.

   If this rule is not obeyed, SiT will cancel your booking and the Office of International Relations will immediately allocate the room to another student! You must then arrange for private
   housing on your own.

   After you have received the contract you should contact SiT (not the Office of International Relations) if you have any questions related to housing, the contract etc. at the student village.

   If you have received a contract from SiT and for some reason do not accept the contract or want to cancel it please inform both the Office of International Relations (housing@adm.ntnu.no) and
   SiT, bolig@sit.no.

Student Housing at Persaunet

   Persaunet Student Housing (PSH) is an old nursing home within walking distance from campus Gløshaugen and Tyholt (NTNU). Approximately 160 exchange students from Europe, staying for the fall
   semester, will be living at PSH. (PSH will not be open during the spring semester). The students given such an offer will be contacted by e-mail in June/July.
   During the first few weeks of the semester, there will be a reception at PSH where you can pick up your key. For this period the reception will be open 24 hours a day, so you can just show up
   at PSH whenever arriving.


   There is a bus stop close to the complex with a direct route to campus Dragvoll and the city center. Click here to search and read more about bus routes in Trondheim.
   The adress is Persaunvegen 54, 7046 Trondheim, click here to see the location at the map.
   Approximately 160 students was living at Persaunet for the fall semester 2011. Hopefully PSH will also be available for exchange/visiting students staying for one semester fall 2012 as well.
   As a resident at PSH, you will share your bed room with 1-3 students, depending on the size of the rooms. Each floor will have its own resident representative. These will have a single room to
   compensate for the responsibility and workload. All rooms will be furnished with beds, closets and small desks. There is also a sink in almost every room. The rooms have been equipped to suit
   the demands for student housing.

   You will have common areas such as study rooms, living rooms, shared kitchens and bathrooms. The kitchens will be equipped with necessary articles and equipment for preparing basic meals, but
   if you have special wishes for more advanced equipment, you should bring or buy this yourself. You will also have access to a laundry at Moholt Student Village.

   There will be a wireless internet connection at PSH. This will be free of charge. Due to solid concrete walls there might not be a signal everywhere in the building, but it will at least be
   accessible in the living- and study rooms.

    If you arrive in Trondheim before PSH opens, you'll have to find another place to live in the meantime, i.e. the Interrail Center (http://tirc.no/).

   "Roof over your head" will use a part of the building for their purpose in the first period of the semester. They will have their own bathrooms and common areas and be separated from your
   residences, but you should prepare for a busy time at PSH in this period!

   There is a grocery store (ICA) about 700 meters from PSH. This grocery store also hosts a post office, and you will be able to withdraw cash when buying something with a VISA-card.

   When staying at PSH you will be required to follow certain rules regarding cleaning, noise level etc. These rules will be communicated to the residents when moving in.

    Introductory Programme for Foreign Students (INFPRG)

IFUS programme overview

   The IFUS programme is a full-year course of study designed to teach Norwegian to international students who wish to pursue a degree at NTNU.

   Although NTNU offers more than 30 international masters programmes, all of our bachelor's programmes and a significant number of master's programmes are taught in Norwegian. If you want to
   pursue one of these degrees, you need to fulfill the univerity's Norwegian language requirements as well as other programme-specific requirements. Successful completion of the IFUS course
   enables you to do this.

   IFUS programme graduates are also guaranteed a place in one of the university's bachelor's or master's courses (with certain exceptions, see below) if you have applied directly from abroad. If
   you already live in Norway, the university cannot guarantee you admission after you graduate from IFUS. Instead, you must compete with other Norwegian students for a place at NTNU by applying
   through NUCAS, the Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service. You can read more about the application procedure for students already resident in Norway lower on this page.

   Programme content
   As a IFUS student, you learn the skills you need to master written and spoken Norwegian in academic as well as everyday situations. We also introduce you to Norwegian culture and society.

   The course begins with the basics of Norwegian grammar, syntax and phonetics, and progresses to expanding your vocabulary and knowledge of idiomatic expressions. You also have access to
   listening and pronunciation exercises in the language laboratory. IFUS is worth 60 credits in the Norwegian system. Lectures start in August and last 28 weeks, with 12 hours of class
   instruction and 1 hour of conversation per week. The course ends in mid-May.

   Beyond IFUS
   If you apply to IFUS directly from abroad and are accepted to the programme, you are also guaranteed admission to continue your studies at NTNU. This means that you must list a minimum of three
   alternative degree programmes on your application that you would like to pursue at NTNU. Your admissions letter for the IFUS programme will also include information about where you have been
   accepted to study after you have completed IFUS. However, you cannot apply to an International Master's programme, medicine or professional studies in psychology, music and fine arts through
   the IFUS program.

   Financing
   Athough NTNU does not have tuition fees, you must be able to document your ability to support yourself during your studies in Norway. If you cannot provide this documentation, we cannot offer
   you a place in the programme. Unfortunately you will not be able to apply for financial aid through the Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund, or other government and university grants and
   loans. (The only exception is for applicants married to Norwegian citizens who may qualify for support from the State Educational Loan Fund.)

   Who can apply?
   If you meet the minimum entrance requirements, and can document the ability to finance your studies, you are welcome to apply. However, IFUS is primarily for applicants who intend to study at
   NTNU after the completion of the programme. You may also apply if you have an agreement with your home institution to take this course as part of your studies. But note that you cannot have
   attended any previous Norwegian courses, or have any prior knowledge of the language.

   If you live in Norway now
   If you currently live in Norway, you may apply to IFUS, but we can only accept you if the course has places available after we have accepted eligible students who have applied from abroad.
   Remember, you won't be guaranteed a place at NTNU after IFUS, but must apply through NUCAS by March 1st in the year you intend to start your regular studies. Note that most master's programmes
   have their own deadlines and application forms, found on NTNU's "Søknadsweb". NTNU's webpages also contain comprehensive information regarding degree programmes taught in Norwegian.

   The admission requirements for applicants residing in Norway are the same as for regular applicants, except that you do not have to document funding availability or plans of study after IFUS.
   The application deadline for applicants residing in Norway is June 1st in the year you intend to start the IFUS programme. The application form is usually available starting in February each
   year.

   Deadlines and application dates
   December 1st - PRELIMINARY APPLICATION : The preliminary application deadline for the IFUS programme is December 1st for the following academic year. (Applicants residing in Norway will be
   rejected).

   February 15th - FINAL APPLICATION : Qualified candidates receive the final application form in January, which has to be returned by February 15th.

   April- ACCEPTANCE LETTERS SENT - The admissions process will normally be finalized by the end of April.

   June 1st - Application deadline for applicants already residing in Norway.

   The selection process
   The places in the IFUS programme are strictly reserved for candidates with good academic qualifications and ability to document sufficient funding for their studies. A maximum of 15 students
   may be admitted to this programme each year. Applicants residing abroad will be given priority. Applicants residing in Norway will be considered when possible.

Welcome Programme !

   We strongly encourage all new students to attend the orientation/welcome program at the beginning of each semester. It is an ideal opportunity to become acquainted with NTNU and Trondheim, have
   a good time and make some new friends.

   Although NTNU offers more than 30 international masters programmes, all of our bachelor's programmes and a significant number of master's programmes are taught in Norwegian. If you want to
   pursue one of these degrees, you need to fulfill the univerity's Norwegian language requirements as well as other programme-specific requirements. Successful completion of the IFUS course
   enables you to do this.

   IFUS programme graduates are also guaranteed a place in one of the university's bachelor's or master's courses (with certain exceptions, see below) if you have applied directly from abroad. If
   you already live in Norway, the university cannot guarantee you admission after you graduate from IFUS. Instead, you must compete with other Norwegian students for a place at NTNU by applying
   through NUCAS, the Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service. You can read more about the application procedure for students already resident in Norway lower on this page.

   Programme content
   As a IFUS student, you learn the skills you need to master written and spoken Norwegian in academic as well as everyday situations. We also introduce you to Norwegian culture and society.

   The course begins with the basics of Norwegian grammar, syntax and phonetics, and progresses to expanding your vocabulary and knowledge of idiomatic expressions. You also have access to
   listening and pronunciation exercises in the language laboratory. IFUS is worth 60 credits in the Norwegian system. Lectures start in August and last 28 weeks, with 12 hours of class
   instruction and 1 hour of conversation per week. The course ends in mid-May.

   Beyond IFUS
   If you apply to IFUS directly from abroad and are accepted to the programme, you are also guaranteed admission to continue your studies at NTNU. This means that you must list a minimum of three
   alternative degree programmes on your application that you would like to pursue at NTNU. Your admissions letter for the IFUS programme will also include information about where you have been
   accepted to study after you have completed IFUS. However, you cannot apply to an International Master's programme, medicine or professional studies in psychology, music and fine arts through
   the IFUS program.

   Financing
   Athough NTNU does not have tuition fees, you must be able to document your ability to support yourself during your studies in Norway. If you cannot provide this documentation, we cannot offer
   you a place in the programme. Unfortunately you will not be able to apply for financial aid through the Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund, or other government and university grants and
   loans. (The only exception is for applicants married to Norwegian citizens who may qualify for support from the State Educational Loan Fund.)

   Who can apply?
   If you meet the minimum entrance requirements, and can document the ability to finance your studies, you are welcome to apply. However, IFUS is primarily for applicants who intend to study at
   NTNU after the completion of the programme. You may also apply if you have an agreement with your home institution to take this course as part of your studies. But note that you cannot have
   attended any previous Norwegian courses, or have any prior knowledge of the language.

   If you live in Norway now
   If you currently live in Norway, you may apply to IFUS, but we can only accept you if the course has places available after we have accepted eligible students who have applied from abroad.
   Remember, you won't be guaranteed a place at NTNU after IFUS, but must apply through NUCAS by March 1st in the year you intend to start your regular studies. Note that most master's programmes
   have their own deadlines and application forms, found on NTNU's "Søknadsweb". NTNU's webpages also contain comprehensive information regarding degree programmes taught in Norwegian.

   The admission requirements for applicants residing in Norway are the same as for regular applicants, except that you do not have to document funding availability or plans of study after IFUS.
   The application deadline for applicants residing in Norway is June 1st in the year you intend to start the IFUS programme. The application form is usually available starting in February each
   year.

   Deadlines and application dates
   December 1st - PRELIMINARY APPLICATION : The preliminary application deadline for the IFUS programme is December 1st for the following academic year. (Applicants residing in Norway will be
   rejected).

   February 15th - FINAL APPLICATION : Qualified candidates receive the final application form in January, which has to be returned by February 15th.

   April- ACCEPTANCE LETTERS SENT - The admissions process will normally be finalized by the end of April.

   June 1st - Application deadline for applicants already residing in Norway.

   The selection process
   The places in the IFUS programme are strictly reserved for candidates with good academic qualifications and ability to document sufficient funding for their studies. A maximum of 15 students
   may be admitted to this programme each year. Applicants residing abroad will be given priority. Applicants residing in Norway will be considered when possible.

Language requirements and courses

   NTNU is a Norwegian university with a strong international presence. That means our students and staff must be able to communicate clearly in English.

   Illustrasjonsbilde/FOTO

   English is a compulsory part of Norwegian schooling, so practically every Norwegian has a working knowledge of the language. And because English is very often the language of academic research,
   NTNU requires its ordinary degree students to be proficient in English as well as Norwegian. Exchange students, and students pursuing an international master's or PhD programme generally do not
   need to comply with the university's Norwegian requirement (although all are welcomed to learn Norwegian), but they do have to be able to speak English. Here's a summary of the university's
   language requirements:
     * English Proficiency Requirements at NTNU
     * English Proficiency Testing (TOEFL / IELTS)
     * Norwegian Requirements at NTNU (Degree seeking students)

   Learning Norwegian
   If you want to learn Norwegian, NTNU and other institutions offer various Norwegian language courses. Anyone who has been hired into a permanent position at NTNU who does not already speak
   Norwegian or another Scandinavian language is required to master Norwegian (or another Scandinavian language) within three years of his or her start date. This means being able to communicate
   at "level 3" (or the equivalent) of the Norwegian for Foreigners course given by the Department of Language and Communication Studies.

PhD coursework and research requirements

   Just what can you expect from a PhD programme at NTNU? Cutting edge research, camaraderie from fellow PhD candidates, and world class instruction, to begin with. What follows is a description
   of the formal aspects of obtaining a PhD at NTNU.

   The candidate must be admitted (pdf) to a specific PhD programme in order to earn a degree from NTNU. One requirement that is common to all PhD programmes is that the research fellow must
   undertake both research and coursework.

Dissertation

   The research portion of the PhD is comprised of a completed dissertation, which is defended publicly and approved by a committee appointed by NTNU. A dissertation can be written in book form,
   or submitted as a collection of articles.

PhD coursework

   The coursework portion of the PhD requires completion of a course load equal to 30 study points (equivalent to one semester), consisting of a variety of PhD-level courses. Coursework is
   typically programme specific, and courses can be taken at NTNU and at other universities. A student must pass all of his or her courses before he or she can submit his or her dissertation.

Supervision

   PhD research fellows conduct their research under the watchful eye of a main supervisor. Typically, the candidate will apply for a PhD position on a particular project or in a research field
   and be assigned a supervisor by the relevant PhD program. In some cases, the candidate first finds a willing supervisor before he or she begins the application process. Contact people at the
   different PhD programmes can be helpful in putting the candidate in contact with potential supervisors.

   PhD candidates are normally given a yearly budget which is designed to cover travel costs, equipment and other expenses associated with their education.

Joint degrees and cotutelle agreements (joint supervision) in doctoral degree training

    1. What is a joint degree?
    2. What is a cotutelle agreement?
    3. Why establish joint degrees or cotutelle agreements (joint supervision)?
    4. Guidelines for cotutelle agreements (joint supervision) and joint degrees at NTNU
    5. Practical matters - procedures for entering into agreements

1. What is a joint degree?

   Joint degree means that two (or more) institutions jointly initiate a doctoral degree programme leading to a joint degree. The joint degree can be documented through a joint diploma from the
   institutions or through a diploma from each of the institutions.

2. What is a cotutelle agreement?

   Cotutelle is an agreement on joint supervision on the doctoral degree level. The programme originated in France, hence the term cotutelle (as in co-tutoring). Such agreements can be entered
   into between the two cooperating institutions, the PhD candidate and the candidate's supervisors. The cotutelle agreement regulates enrolment, supervision and the evaluation of the candidate's
   doctoral degree dissertation. A cotutelle agreement must always be entered into on the individual level, but institutional agreements can also be made on cotutelle cooperation. The candidate
   receives a diploma from each of the institutions.

   The terms Joint PhD or Joint Doctorate are used and defined somewhat differently from country to country.

3. Why establish joint degrees or cotutelle agreements (joint supervision)?

   NTNU's strategic objective is to increase its level of internationalisation. Establishing joint degrees in collaboration with universities abroad will lead to more binding cooperation, and will
   promote NTNU's international ambitions. In NTNU's strategy document "NTNU 2020 Internasjonalt fremragende" (NTNU 2020 - Internationally Outstanding), the performance target for 2010 is that the
   number of joint degree agreements with international universities will increase by 70 per cent compared to 2007. This also applies to joint degrees on the PhD level. Joint degrees and study
   programmes with universities that are among the 20 best in Europe are defined as a target for 2020. Establishing joint degrees is also an explicit goal in the Bologna process.

   Establishing joint degrees means that several academic environments that on their own may be relatively small can offer study programmes together which they could not have managed to offer on
   their own. The primary goal of joint degrees should be to raise the quality of both the training and the research in the academic field in question and should provide the institution with added
   value.

   As a stage in international cooperation and the intention that PhD candidates should have a research stay at an institution abroad, an agreement on joint supervision (cotutelle agreement) will
   formalise this collaborative effort. For the candidate, it will be beneficial to have documentation that he or she has education from more than one institution. The candidate will also have
   supervisors appointed at both institutions.

4. Guidelines for cotutelle agreements (joint supervision) and joint degrees at NTNU

   NTNU's board of directors has determined guidelines for cotutelle agreements and joint degrees, cf. S-case 83/08, 4 December 2008.

   "Such an agreement is as a minimum to cover enrolment, funding, academic training, supervision, residency requirements at the institutions, reporting requirements, the language and structure of
   the thesis, its evaluation, the award of the degree, the issue of the certificate and the ownership of intellectual property rights to the results."

   The PhD training must have a scope of three years of normal study time, and the candidate must be enrolled in both institutions. It is a requirement that the entire dissertation and its
   attachments are made public.

Guidelines

    1. NTNU may enter into agreements on cotutelle cooperation on the PhD level with universities abroad.
    2. The agreement must be signed by the two supervisors, the Dean, the PhD candidate and the Rector.
    3. The candidate must be enrolled in both institutions. The academic basis for enrolment must be a Master's degree or similar.
    4. The PhD training must have a scope of three years of normal studies.
    5. The candidate must have at least one supervisor at each institution.
    6. The training part must satisfy the requirements of both institutions.
    7. The candidate must have a period of stay at both institutions. The agreement should specify when the candidate is to stay at each institution.
    8. The candidate must have a place to work, access to laboratory facilities and other infrastructure at each institution.
    9. The dissertation must have the logo of both institutions, and the cooperation agreement must be specified.
   10. The dissertation and its attachment must be made public.
   11. The agreement must regulate the composition of the assessment committee.
   12. For the public presentation of the dissertation, the rules that are in force at the institution where the presentation is to be given must be complied with.
   13. The candidate shall receive a diploma from each institution.
   14. Both institutions shall have the right to use the dissertation and the results in their education, training and research.

   The guidelines apply in the same way to joint degrees where a number of institutions agree to establish a joint doctoral degree programme. With joint degrees, the candidate may receive a
   diploma from each institution or a joint diploma.

5. Practical matters - procedures for entering into agreements

   The following procedures must be complied with when making agreements on joint degrees or joint supervision (cotutelle):
    1. Academic communities intending to enter into agreements on joint degrees or joint supervision (cotutelle) must contact their administration (dean, head of department) to ensure they have
       the administration's support with respect to entering into a cooperation agreement with the institution in question.
    2. After receiving positive confirmation from the administration, negotiations are then initiated by the academic communities. The academic community is urged to contact the Department of
       Academic Affairs early in the process to obtain advice and guidance.
       Contact persons at the Department of Academic Affairs:
       Advisor Jon Inge Resell, tel.: +47 73595259, e-mail: jon.resell@ntnu.no.
       Legal consultant Anne Marie Snekvik, tel.: +47 73595294 e-mail: anne.snekvik@ntnu.no.
    3. One of the institution's standard agreement templates must be used, but both institutions' cooperation requirements must be satisfied.
    4. When the agreement has been drawn up, the faculty sends it together with the necessary information to the Department of Academic Affairs, which presents the agreement and the faculty's
       information to the Rector. The Department of Academic Affairs also submits a brief statement on whether the agreement is in accordance with NTNU's guidelines.
    5. The Rector assesses whether the agreement is in accordance with the university's policy and signs the agreement if it is. The Rector may be advised by the Committee of Education or the
       Dean's Meeting if this is deemed necessary.
    6. The Department of Academic Affairs returns the agreement to the Faculty. The Faculty files the agreement when it has been signed by all the parties, and sends a copy of the signed agreement
       to the Department of Academic Affairs.
    7. The Department of Academic Affairs reports all agreements on joint degrees to NOKUT (Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education).

   The Department of Academic Affairs has prepared a template for joint supervision (cotutelle agreement). This can be used as the point of departure for negotiations on cooperation with another
   institution.

   Link to the agreement template: http://www.ntnu.no/studieavd/dok/cotutelle_agreement.pdf.

   The template was prepared in 2008. Section 13 was modified in October 2011.

    1. Academic communities intending to enter into agreements on joint degrees or joint supervision (cotutelle) must contact their administration (dean, head of department) to ensure they have
       the administration's support with respect to entering into a cooperation agreement with the institution in question.
    2. After receiving positive confirmation from the administration, negotiations are then initiated by the academic communities. The academic community is urged to contact the Department of
       Academic Affairs early in the process to obtain advice and guidance.
       Contact persons at the Department of Academic Affairs:
       Advisor Jon Inge Resell, tel.: +47 73595259, e-mail: jon.resell@ntnu.no.
       Legal consultant Anne Marie Snekvik, tel.: +47 73595294 e-mail: anne.snekvik@ntnu.no.
    3. One of the institution's standard agreement templates must be used, but both institutions' cooperation requirements must be satisfied.
    4. When the agreement has been drawn up, the faculty sends it together with the necessary information to the Department of Academic Affairs, which presents the agreement and the faculty's
       information to the Rector. The Department of Academic Affairs also submits a brief statement on whether the agreement is in accordance with NTNU's guidelines.
    5. The Rector assesses whether the agreement is in accordance with the university's policy and signs the agreement if it is. The Rector may be advised by the Committee of Education or the
       Dean's Meeting if this is deemed necessary.
    6. The Department of Academic Affairs returns the agreement to the Faculty. The Faculty files the agreement when it has been signed by all the parties, and sends a copy of the signed agreement
       to the Department of Academic Affairs.
    7. The Department of Academic Affairs reports all agreements on joint degrees to NOKUT (Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education).

   The Department of Academic Affairs has prepared a template for joint supervision (cotutelle agreement). This can be used as the point of departure for negotiations on cooperation with another
   institution.

   Link to the agreement template: http://www.ntnu.no/studieavd/dok/cotutelle_agreement.pdf.

   The template was prepared in 2008. Section 13 was modified in October 2011.

Financing your PhD

   If you want to do your PhD at NTNU, you should start by checking the jobs and vacancies listings on the university's website.

   You must have financing in place before beginning your PhD programme, because you cannot submit a formal application for acceptance to a PhD programme unless you have arranged for financing.

   Funding is out there, whether in the form of stipends from large research projects or from open fellowships. You can read more about these in the box to the right. The availability of different
   types of financing programmes is also advertised by NTNU on the vacancies webpage. Business and industry may also be a source of PhD funding.

   The level of detail required for a stipend application or fellowship application varies, depending on the different departments, and students should therefore be aware of department
   recommendations, rules and requirements.

   There is also a great deal of variability in the number of stipends that are announced during the course of the year, as well as the number of applicants who seek funding from the different
   disciplines.

   Acceptance to a PhD programme
   Once financing is in place, a student may apply for acceptance to a PhD programme. There is a specific form for PhD candidate applications. A study plan and a project plan must be developed in
   conjunction with the student's main supervisor.

   A detailed description of an application and project plan can be found in the PhD regulations (§ 5.2).

Funding opportunities

Quota Scheme

   Master's degree programmes

   The Norwegian Quota Scheme is a funding Scheme offered by the Norwegian Government to students from developing countries in the South and countries in the Western Balkans, Eastern Europe and in
   Central Asia. The goal of the Quota Scheme is to give students relevant education that will also benefit their home countries when the return after graduation.

   Please see more information about the Quota Scheme at the webpage for the Norwegian Centre for International Cooperation in Higher Education (SiU)
   Applicants, who live in another country than their country of citizenship, either temporarily or permanently, can not apply.

   Only applicants from institutions with which NTNU has a formal cooperation agreement are eligible to apply.

   You may be eligible for financial support under the Quota Scheme if you are permanently or temporary employed or if you are a student with a first degree or are presently studying at one of the
   institutions where NTNU has a formal cooperation agreement. Preference is given to applicants who are linked to active and formalized cooperation/projects within the specific subject area.

   To be eligible, you must also have stayed at least one year in your home country directly prior to when you plan to undertake your education to NTNU. This means that you cannot apply for
   financial support from another country than your own.

   List of NTNU's formal cooperation agreements

Placement is competitive

   The few Quota seats available, compared to the high number of applicants competing, make this source of funding extremely competitive.

   Due to few Quota Seats available, not all MSc/MPhil programmes will be allocated with Quota Seats, the decision will be made internally at NTNU in November.
   Please note that there are no PhD places available for 2013-2014.
   Students should still apply for the programme they are interested in and qualified for, but unfortunately, we can not guarantee that all programmes will be allocated Quota Seats.

   Application information

   The deadline for submitting applications for the fourth NUFU Period (2007 - 2011) has passed. Initially the applications were evaluated externally. The next step in the process was an
   institutional assessment of each application by the institutions in the South and in the North. The NUFU Board made the final decision based on the external evaluations and institutional
   priorities. The priorities of the institutions in the South counts twice as much as the priorities made in the North.

   Application information

   The deadline for submitting applications for the fourth NUFU Period (2007 - 2011) has passed. Initially the applications were evaluated externally. The next step in the process was an
   institutional assessment of each application by the institutions in the South and in the North. The NUFU Board made the final decision based on the external evaluations and institutional
   priorities. The priorities of the institutions in the South counts twice as much as the priorities made in the North.

   However, students do need to cover their living expenses, including housing, books, food and travel. What follows is a list of the main funding alternatives available to international students.

                                                                                                                    Name/programme

Quota Scheme

   Master's degree programmes

   The Norwegian Quota Scheme is a funding Scheme offered by the Norwegian Government to students from developing countries in the South and countries in the Western Balkans, Eastern Europe and in
   Central Asia. The goal of the Quota Scheme is to give students relevant education that will also benefit their home countries when the return after graduation.

   Please see more information about the Quota Scheme at the webpage for the Norwegian Centre for International Cooperation in Higher Education (SiU)
   Applicants, who live in another country than their country of citizenship, either temporarily or permanently, can not apply.

   Only applicants from institutions with which NTNU has a formal cooperation agreement are eligible to apply.

   You may be eligible for financial support under the Quota Scheme if you are permanently or temporary employed or if you are a student with a first degree or are presently studying at one of the
   institutions where NTNU has a formal cooperation agreement. Preference is given to applicants who are linked to active and formalized cooperation/projects within the specific subject area.

   To be eligible, you must also have stayed at least one year in your home country directly prior to when you plan to undertake your education to NTNU. This means that you cannot apply for
   financial support from another country than your own.

   List of NTNU's formal cooperation agreements

Placement is competitive

   The few Quota seats available, compared to the high number of applicants competing, make this source of funding extremely competitive.

   Due to few Quota Seats available, not all MSc/MPhil programmes will be allocated with Quota Seats, the decision will be made internally at NTNU in November.
   Please note that there are no PhD places available for 2013-2014.
   Students should still apply for the programme they are interested in and qualified for, but unfortunately, we can not guarantee that all programmes will be allocated Quota Seats.

   Application information

   The deadline for submitting applications for the fourth NUFU Period (2007 - 2011) has passed. Initially the applications were evaluated externally. The next step in the process was an
   institutional assessment of each application by the institutions in the South and in the North. The NUFU Board made the final decision based on the external evaluations and institutional
   priorities. The priorities of the institutions in the South counts twice as much as the priorities made in the North.

Self-financing

   Students who will either pursue an undergraduate degree or an International Master's Programme at NTNU and who are not eligible for a fellowship or scholarship programme, are welcome at NTNU
   provided they can pay their living expenses. Please note, there are no tuition fees at NTNU!

   Minimum funding requirements
   Regulations from the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration state that all international students who are not citizens of EU/EEA/EFTA countries need to apply for a residence permit for students
   (www.udi.no). This means that applicants for undergraduate or international master's programmes at NTNU under the Individual funding category must document their funding source(s)
   (NOK 92,500 for 2012/2013) in their application. Even though an international master's programme has a duration of two years, applicants only need to document funding for one year in their
   application.

   How to provide documentation
   In your application for admission to an international master's programme, you may document financing by means of a bank statement and a letter of confirmation from your sponsor, but The
   Norwegian Directorate of Immigration will only accept confirmation of scholarships or grants or bank guarantees from a Norwegian bank.

   Students in the "individual funding category" who are admitted to an international master's programme will be requested to transfer NOK 92,500 (2012/2013) to NTNU's deposit account before their
   arrival in Norway. This deposit is for covering life expences only (NTNU does not have tuition fees). The money will be transferred to the student's Norwegian bank account once the student has
   opened one. Information about the practical arrangements for transferring the money to the Norwegian bank account will be provided along with the admissions letter.

   Examinations at NTNU

Information about cheating and academic misconduct

   On 12 October 2006, the Board of NTNU passed Guidelines concerning the action to be taken in cases of students cheating or attempting to cheat at examinations at NTNU. This extract from these
   Guidelines is written to give students important information about this matter.NTNU regards cheating as a serious matter with grave consequences when a student is even suspected of cheating.
   Failing to respect the work of others by not citing sources can lead to an examination being failed and even expulsion from NTNU and all higher education in Norway for up to one year.

   NTNU defines cheating as actions that are in conflict with the examination regulations that lead to the results being more favourably judged than would otherwise be the case. This is a broad
   definition that includes gross negligence. The following examples clarify what NTNU can regard as cheating:
     * An examination answer paper with all or some of the text from the Internet that is presented as the student's own work
     * An examination answer paper with all or some of the text used by someone else at a previous examination
     * An examination answer paper with all or some of the text used by the student at a previous examination
     * An examination answer paper with all or some of the text written by someone else
     * Work that is handed in as the student's own work that is written, designed or composed by someone else
     * Quotes from textbooks, other sources, or the Internet that are not presented with their sources and are not clearly marked as quotations (plagiarism)
     * Using examination support material that is not permitted

   Ask your professors, Student Service or student advisers at NTNU if you are unsure about the rules relating to cheating. It is the student's own responsibility to find out about the rules
   relating to the use of other people's work - plagiarism - which is against Norwegian law (see below). In an examination, each student must find out what examination support material is
   permitted.

   Plagiarism detection
   NTNU has acquired a system for plagiarism detection. This system is designed to detect plagiarism in examination answer papers submitted in connection with teaching at NTNU. This means that
   texts submitted by students in courses at NTNU can be checked for plagiarism.


   What Norwegian law says about cheating

   The Act of 1 April 2005 relating to Universities and University Colleges Section 4-7, Subsection 1, b. states that the University Appeals Committee can annul an examination or test or approval
   of a course if the student has

   attempted to cheat or on purpose or with gross negligence has cheated in the course of or prior to the final assessment of the examination or test concerned, or while taking the course in
   question.

   Annulment of the examination (The above Law, Section 4-7, Subsection 1, b)
   The least severe reaction is annulment of the examination. Annulment alone is used in the least serious cases of cheating. An attempt to cheat includes gross negligence. The matter is decided
   by the University Appeals Committee.

   Suspension from further studies (The above Law, Section 4-8, Subsection 3)
   In the graver cases of cheating the student may be excluded from NTNU and may lose the right to take examinations at other institutions covered by the Act relating to Universities and
   University Colleges for a period of one year. The matters is decided by the University Appeals Committee and requires two-thirds majority, see Act of 1 April 2005 relating to Universities and
   University Colleges Section 4-8, Subsection 4.

   NTNU's Examination Regulations can be found on http://www.ntnu.no/studier/reglement. See Examination Regulations at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) (pdf).

   On 12 October 2006, the Board of NTNU passed Guidelines concerning the action to be taken in cases of students cheating or attempting to cheat at examinations at NTNU. This extract from these
   Guidelines is written to give students important information about this matter.NTNU regards cheating as a serious matter with grave consequences when a student is even suspected of cheating.
   Failing to respect the work of others by not citing sources can lead to an examination being failed and even expulsion from NTNU and all higher education in Norway for up to one year.

   NTNU defines cheating as actions that are in conflict with the examination regulations that lead to the results being more favourably judged than would otherwise be the case. This is a broad
   definition that includes gross negligence. The following examples clarify what NTNU can regard as cheating:
     * An examination answer paper with all or some of the text from the Internet that is presented as the student's own work
     * An examination answer paper with all or some of the text used by someone else at a previous examination
     * An examination answer paper with all or some of the text used by the student at a previous examination
     * An examination answer paper with all or some of the text written by someone else
     * Work that is handed in as the student's own work that is written, designed or composed by someone else
     * Quotes from textbooks, other sources, or the Internet that are not presented with their sources and are not clearly marked as quotations (plagiarism)
     * Using examination support material that is not permitted

   Ask your professors, Student Service or student advisers at NTNU if you are unsure about the rules relating to cheating. It is the student's own responsibility to find out about the rules
   relating to the use of other people's work - plagiarism - which is against Norwegian law (see below). In an examination, each student must find out what examination support material is
   permitted.

   Plagiarism detection
   NTNU has acquired a system for plagiarism detection. This system is designed to detect plagiarism in examination answer papers submitted in connection with teaching at NTNU. This means that
   texts submitted by students in courses at NTNU can be checked for plagiarism.


   What Norwegian law says about cheating

   The Act of 1 April 2005 relating to Universities and University Colleges Section 4-7, Subsection 1, b. states that the University Appeals Committee can annul an examination or test or approval
   of a course if the student has

   attempted to cheat or on purpose or with gross negligence has cheated in the course of or prior to the final assessment of the examination or test concerned, or while taking the course in
   question.

   Annulment of the examination (The above Law, Section 4-7, Subsection 1, b)
   The least severe reaction is annulment of the examination. Annulment alone is used in the least serious cases of cheating. An attempt to cheat includes gross negligence. The matter is decided
   by the University Appeals Committee.

   Suspension from further studies (The above Law, Section 4-8, Subsection 3)
   In the graver cases of cheating the student may be excluded from NTNU and may lose the right to take examinations at other institutions covered by the Act relating to Universities and
   University Colleges for a period of one year. The matters is decided by the University Appeals Committee and requires two-thirds majority, see Act of 1 April 2005 relating to Universities and
   University Colleges Section 4-8, Subsection 4.

   Examinations at NTNU

Complaints about grades and examinations

   If you have a complaint about examinations you've taken, or grades or marks you've received at NTNU, you have to follow an appeal procedure outlined in Norwegian law.

   The following extract from the Act relating to Universities and University Colleges of 1 April 2005 explains some of the central issues:

   Section 3-9. Examinations and marking
   Section 5-2. Complaints against procedural errors in connection with examinations
   Section 5-3. Complaints regarding marks awarded - right to explanation


   Section 3-9. Examinations and marking

   (1) Universities and university colleges shall ensure that students' knowledge and skills are tested and assessed in a manner that is impartial and academically sound.

   Assessment shall also safeguard the academic standards of the course of study in question. An external evaluation shall be made of the assessment or assessment arrangements.

   (2) The board shall appoint examiners for examinations, tests, assessments of assignments or other assessments the results of which are entered on the diploma or included in the mark given for
   the course of study in question. When assessing candidates' independent work in higher degree courses, each candidate shall be assessed by at least two examiners, of whom at least one shall be
   external.

   (3) The oral parts of examinations and tests shall be public unless regard for the examination or test arrangements indicates otherwise. The board may make exceptions to the rule concerning
   public examinations in particular cases at the request of the examination candidate concerned when particularly weighty reasons so indicate.

   (4) Marks shall be made known within three weeks unless for special reasons more time is required. The board may itself make exceptions in respect of specific examinations and may in temporary
   regulations pursuant to the seventh paragraph set a longer time limit when it is not possible to provide the number of qualified examiners required to complete the marking within three weeks.
   The board may itself in a regulation pursuant to the seventh paragraph set a longer time limit for dissertations and similar large written works.

   (5) Re-marking pursuant to sections 5-2 and 5-3 shall be carried out by at least two new examiners, of whom at least one shall be external. Marks may be changed in the appellant's favour and
   disfavour. If the final mark is set on the basis of both a written and an oral test and an appeal against a mark for the written part of the examination is upheld, a new oral test shall be held
   to determine the final mark.

   (6) The mark awarded following an examination, test, assessment of an assignment or other assessment shall either be pass/fail or be based on a graded scale of six marks from A to F, where A to
   E indicate a pass and F indicates a fail.

   (7) The board itself issues regulations governing the taking and arrangement of examinations and tests, including the conditions for resitting an examination or test and for permission to
   retake a practice period, and provisions concerning registration and the conditions for registration for examinations. In the case of courses for which national curriculum regulations have been
   established pursuant to section 3-2, second paragraph, the regulations must be based on any general provisions concerning examinations and assessment contained in the curriculum regulations.
   The board may delegate the issue of supplementary provisions concerning special circumstances relating to particular examinations to a faculty or department.


   Section 5-2. Complaints against procedural errors in connection with examinations

   (1) A candidate who has taken an examination or test may complain of procedural errors within three weeks of the date when he or she became or should have become aware of the circumstance on
   which the complaint is based. Such complaints are ruled on by the board itself or the institution's appeals committee.

   (2) If an error was committed which may have affected the student's performance or its assessment, the mark shall be rescinded. If the error can be corrected by re-marking the papers submitted,
   they shall be re-marked. Otherwise a new examination or test shall be held with new examiners. The mark awarded in a second assessment pursuant to the present section may be appealed against
   pursuant to the provisions laid down in section 5-3.

   (3) If a request for explanation of or an appeal against a mark has been submitted, the time limit for an appeal pursuant to this section is reckoned from the date when the student receives the
   explanation or when the appeal is finally ruled on.

   (4) If the board or the board's appeals committee finds that formal errors were committed and that this can reasonably be supposed to have affected the performance of one or more candidates or
   the assessment of that performance, the decision may be taken to carry out a new assessment or to hold a new examination or test.


   Section 5-3. Complaints regarding marks awarded - right to explanation

   (1) A student is entitled to an explanation of the marks awarded for his or her performance. At oral examinations or assessments of practical skills, a request for such an explanation must be
   made immediately on notification of the mark. Requests for explanations of other assessments must be submitted within one week after the candidate learns of the mark, but never more than three
   weeks after the announcement of the mark.

   (2) Explanations shall normally be given within two weeks after the candidate requests them. They shall state the general principles on which the assessment was based and explain the assessment
   of the candidate's performance. Explanations may be given orally or in writing at the examiner's discretion.

   (3) If written guidelines for assessments have been issued, they shall be available to students after the marks have been decided.

   (4) A student may appeal in writing against a mark awarded for his or her performance within three weeks of the announcement of the examination results. The performance shall then be
   reassessed. In the event of a request for an explanation of a mark or a complaint of procedural errors in the question-setting, the examination procedure or the assessment procedure, the time
   limit for appeals pursuant to this section is reckoned from the date when the student receives the explanation or when the appeal is finally ruled on. In connection with the use of continuous
   assessment, the institution may decide whether the student shall submit an appeal following the assessment of a separate examination, assignment or other assessment or whether an appeal shall
   be submitted on announcement of the result of assessment of the study programme, discipline, or module.

   (5) Appeals may not be lodged against marks awarded for oral performance and assessment of practical training or the like which, owing to the nature of the test cannot be reviewed. The results
   of preliminary examinations (forprøver) may only be appealed against when the examination is failed.

   (6) Marks awarded following re-marking pursuant to this section may not be appealed against.

Complaints about grades and examinations

   If you have a complaint about examinations you've taken, or grades or marks you've received at NTNU, you have to follow an appeal procedure outlined in Norwegian law.

   The following extract from the Act relating to Universities and University Colleges of 1 April 2005 explains some of the central issues:

   Section 3-9. Examinations and marking
   Section 5-2. Complaints against procedural errors in connection with examinations
   Section 5-3. Complaints regarding marks awarded - right to explanation


   Section 3-9. Examinations and marking

   (1) Universities and university colleges shall ensure that students' knowledge and skills are tested and assessed in a manner that is impartial and academically sound.

   Assessment shall also safeguard the academic standards of the course of study in question. An external evaluation shall be made of the assessment or assessment arrangements.

   (2) The board shall appoint examiners for examinations, tests, assessments of assignments or other assessments the results of which are entered on the diploma or included in the mark given for
   the course of study in question. When assessing candidates' independent work in higher degree courses, each candidate shall be assessed by at least two examiners, of whom at least one shall be
   external.

   (3) The oral parts of examinations and tests shall be public unless regard for the examination or test arrangements indicates otherwise. The board may make exceptions to the rule concerning
   public examinations in particular cases at the request of the examination candidate concerned when particularly weighty reasons so indicate.

   (4) Marks shall be made known within three weeks unless for special reasons more time is required. The board may itself make exceptions in respect of specific examinations and may in temporary
   regulations pursuant to the seventh paragraph set a longer time limit when it is not possible to provide the number of qualified examiners required to complete the marking within three weeks.
   The board may itself in a regulation pursuant to the seventh paragraph set a longer time limit for dissertations and similar large written works.

   (5) Re-marking pursuant to sections 5-2 and 5-3 shall be carried out by at least two new examiners, of whom at least one shall be external. Marks may be changed in the appellant's favour and
   disfavour. If the final mark is set on the basis of both a written and an oral test and an appeal against a mark for the written part of the examination is upheld, a new oral test shall be held
   to determine the final mark.

   (6) The mark awarded following an examination, test, assessment of an assignment or other assessment shall either be pass/fail or be based on a graded scale of six marks from A to F, where A to
   E indicate a pass and F indicates a fail.

   (7) The board itself issues regulations governing the taking and arrangement of examinations and tests, including the conditions for resitting an examination or test and for permission to
   retake a practice period, and provisions concerning registration and the conditions for registration for examinations. In the case of courses for which national curriculum regulations have been
   established pursuant to section 3-2, second paragraph, the regulations must be based on any general provisions concerning examinations and assessment contained in the curriculum regulations.
   The board may delegate the issue of supplementary provisions concerning special circumstances relating to particular examinations to a faculty or department.


   Section 5-2. Complaints against procedural errors in connection with examinations

   (1) A candidate who has taken an examination or test may complain of procedural errors within three weeks of the date when he or she became or should have become aware of the circumstance on
   which the complaint is based. Such complaints are ruled on by the board itself or the institution's appeals committee.

   (2) If an error was committed which may have affected the student's performance or its assessment, the mark shall be rescinded. If the error can be corrected by re-marking the papers submitted,
   they shall be re-marked. Otherwise a new examination or test shall be held with new examiners. The mark awarded in a second assessment pursuant to the present section may be appealed against
   pursuant to the provisions laid down in section 5-3.

   (3) If a request for explanation of or an appeal against a mark has been submitted, the time limit for an appeal pursuant to this section is reckoned from the date when the student receives the
   explanation or when the appeal is finally ruled on.

   (4) If the board or the board's appeals committee finds that formal errors were committed and that this can reasonably be supposed to have affected the performance of one or more candidates or
   the assessment of that performance, the decision may be taken to carry out a new assessment or to hold a new examination or test.


   Section 5-3. Complaints regarding marks awarded - right to explanation

   (1) A student is entitled to an explanation of the marks awarded for his or her performance. At oral examinations or assessments of practical skills, a request for such an explanation must be
   made immediately on notification of the mark. Requests for explanations of other assessments must be submitted within one week after the candidate learns of the mark, but never more than three
   weeks after the announcement of the mark.

   (2) Explanations shall normally be given within two weeks after the candidate requests them. They shall state the general principles on which the assessment was based and explain the assessment
   of the candidate's performance. Explanations may be given orally or in writing at the examiner's discretion.

   (3) If written guidelines for assessments have been issued, they shall be available to students after the marks have been decided.

   (4) A student may appeal in writing against a mark awarded for his or her performance within three weeks of the announcement of the examination results. The performance shall then be
   reassessed. In the event of a request for an explanation of a mark or a complaint of procedural errors in the question-setting, the examination procedure or the assessment procedure, the time
   limit for appeals pursuant to this section is reckoned from the date when the student receives the explanation or when the appeal is finally ruled on. In connection with the use of continuous
   assessment, the institution may decide whether the student shall submit an appeal following the assessment of a separate examination, assignment or other assessment or whether an appeal shall
   be submitted on announcement of the result of assessment of the study programme, discipline, or module.

   (5) Appeals may not be lodged against marks awarded for oral performance and assessment of practical training or the like which, owing to the nature of the test cannot be reviewed. The results
   of preliminary examinations (forprøver) may only be appealed against when the examination is failed.

   (6) Marks awarded following re-marking pursuant to this section may not be appealed against.

   1. What do I do if I want to study at NTNU but I am not Norwegian?

   Much of what you need to know is listed in the frequently asked questions on this page, or on our Studies webpages. There are separate pages for visiting or exchange students, students who wish
   to pursue a bachelor's or master's degree here, or for potential PhD candidates. If you don't find the information you're looking for, the Office of International Relations is the contact point
   for all international students. PhD candidates and international researchers can contact International Staff Services.

   2. Are there organized campus tours of NTNU for international students?

   There are currently no organized campus tours for non-Norwegian students.

   3. What are NTNU's tuition fees?

   There are no tuition fees at NTNU. There are also a very limited number of scholarships available to help with living expenses and other costs.

   All international students who are not citizens of EU/EEA/EFTA countries must be able to document that they have enough funding to live in Norway while attending university.

   The Norwegian immigration authorities will not issue a student residence permit without proof that you have the funds needed to live here. For the 2012-2013 academic year, the minimum amount
   that you must document for the authorities is NOK 92,500 (approximately        US$ 16,000).

   4. What are the costs of living like in Trondheim and Norway??

   There is a one word answer to this: expensive! But to be more specific, you should probably budget about NOK 9,200 per month to cover your basic costs, such as housing, food and other
   university expenses. In fact, this is why the Norwegian government requires students to demonstrate that they have funds of NOK 92,500 (in 2012-2013) before a student residence permit is
   issued. Your single biggest expense will be housing, which is typically between NOK 4000 and NOK 4500, or more, depending upon whether  you live in a little room or something a little larger.

   Many students rent a "hybel", which is a bed-sit (UK English) or a studio apartment (American English). This is often a room in someone's home, typically in the basement (but with windows) and
   with its own entry.

   Food is also very expensive, since most of it must come from outside of Norway. But since there are no tuition expenses in Norway, you have to look at the overall costs of your education in
   that context.

   5. Can I get an undergraduate degree at NTNU if I don't speak Norwegian?

   In a word, no. Nearly all undergraduate level classes are instructed in Norwegian. But if you really want to earn your undergraduate degree here, you can take Norwegian classes at NTNU that
   will eventually enable you to study in Norwegian.

   6. Do I have to speak Norwegian to get a master's or PhD degree at NTNU?

   No. NTNU offers a range of international master's programmes and PhD programmes in English. But you will have to demonstrate that you are proficient in English if you come from a country where
   English is not a native language.

   7. What are the application deadlines?

   The application deadline varies depending on the programme:
     * Exchange students : May 1 for the autumn semester, October 1 for the spring semester.
     * IFUS applicants: December 1 of the year before you intend to start your studies.
     * International master's programmes: December 1 of the year before you intend to start your studies. Final application deadline: February 1.
     * Applicants with a Norwegian or Nordic Degree have a deadline of April 15.
     * Ordinary undergraduate degree programmes taught in Norwegian: Application to the Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service (NUCAS) by March 1 of the same year that you intend to
       start your studies.
     * PhD programmes: The deadlines vary depending upon the individual vacancies, but are typically early in the year for a programme beginning in the autumn.

   8. What do I do if I want to study at NTNU as an exchange student?

   If you want to become an exchange student at NTNU, you have to fill in the application form on our website. The application deadline is May 1 for the autumn semester, and October 1 for the
   spring semester. After you have filled in the form and sent it electronically, you must print it, sign it and send it to us in the post with your transcripts. You can also browse a complete
   list of course descriptions on our website to help you decide what to study while here.

   9. What do I do if I want to study at NTNU as an undergraduate student?

   First, you have to learn Norwegian if it's not your native language -- it's one of the primary admissions requirements. Note that native speakers of Finnish, Swedish and Danish do not have to
   meet the Norwegian language requirement. We offer a one-year full-time course in Norwegian called IFUS for students who would like to study at NTNU but don't know the language. The course
   starts in August every year, but the application deadline is December 1 of the year before you intend to start your studies. After you have passed the Norwegian course, you may continue to
   study at NTNU within your chosen field.

   If you can document your knowledge of Norwegian, you should apply through the Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service (NUCAS). The application deadline for applicants with a
   foreign educational background is March 1 of the same year you intend to start your studies.

   10. What do I do if I want to study at NTNU as a master's student?

   NTNU currently offers more 30 international master's programmes. These programmes are open to applicants who have a bachelor's degree or equivalent in an academic area that is relevant to the
   programme they wish to pursue at NTNU. If you are either employed or a student at one of NTNU's collaborating institutions in Africa, Asia, the Palestinian Areas or Central- and Eastern Europe,
   you may be eligible for a loan and scholarship through the Quota Scheme.

   The Norwegian Agency for International Cooperation and Development also may be a source of funding through the NOMA programme. All master's programmes start in August, and there is no admission
   for the spring semester. For both Quota Scheme applicants and applicants with individual funding, the preliminary application deadline is December 1, with the final application deadline of
   February 1 for applicants who have passed preliminary screening.

   11. What do I do if I want to study at NTNU as a PhD student?

   If you intend to come to NTNU as a PhD candidate, you are advised to contact the relevant Faculty directly. Please see our website on or a list of all faculties and departments at NTNU. You
   should also check our listing of vacant positions. There are no fixed deadlines for PhD applicants, and applications may be submitted at any time, although clearly if you're applying for a
   vacancy, you'll want to adhere to the deadlines in the description.

   12. Do you offer Norwegian courses?

   We do. We have an intensive summer course that lasts for 3-4 weeks, courses that run for the whole semester (you have to pass three semesters to meet NTNU's language requirements) and a
   year-long intensive Norwegian course that upon successful completion meets NTNU's Norwegian requirements. The intensive summer course is mainly intended for exchange students or master's or PhD
   students who are coming to NTNU in the autumn semester and need to learn some Norwegian first, whereas the semester course is intended for students/ employees at NTNU who are staying in Norway
   for some time.Everyone with a residence permit in Norway may apply for this course, however, and some places are reserved for applicants that are not connected to NTNU.

   You can find more information about these courses on our website.

   13. I can't find what I am looking for!

   If all else has failed, you can check the sitemap.

   14.Where do I find course descriptions (ECTS information) ?

   We maintain a list and descriptions of all courses offered at the university, organized by topic.

   15. Where can I find practical information about living in Trondheim?

   We have compiled a range of useful information on our Living in Trondheim webpages.

   16. What do I do about housing for my stay at NTNU?

   All students who have applied for an exchange period at NTNU will receive information about housing from the Office of International Relations. Unfortunately, NTNU cannot guarantee housing for
   all incoming exchange students, although there are programmes in Trondheim to help as described below. Exchange students from countries outside of the EU/EEA are guaranteed housing due to visa
   regulations. Students from within the EU/EEA will be informed when their application to become an exchange student has been processed.

   17. When does the semester start and when are the exam periods?

   Because the dates change from year to year, the easiest way to answer is to have you look at the current calendar.

   18. I need help with my application or I want to know if I have a chance to be accepted to your university! Can you answer specific questions about my application?

   In a word, no. We literally have thousands of applicants every year from around the globe, so we unfortunately cannot offer individual help or guidance to everyone who needs it. We have tried
   to make our webpages as comprehensive as possible, and we believe that you should be able find the information you need on our website. Good luck!

   1. What do I do if I want to study at NTNU but I am not Norwegian?

   Much of what you need to know is listed in the frequently asked questions on this page, or on our Studies webpages. There are separate pages for visiting or exchange students, students who wish
   to pursue a bachelor's or master's degree here, or for potential PhD candidates. If you don't find the information you're looking for, the Office of International Relations is the contact point
   for all international students. PhD candidates and international researchers can contact International Staff Services.

   2. Are there organized campus tours of NTNU for international students?

   There are currently no organized campus tours for non-Norwegian students.

   3. What are NTNU's tuition fees?

   There are no tuition fees at NTNU. There are also a very limited number of scholarships available to help with living expenses and other costs.

   All international students who are not citizens of EU/EEA/EFTA countries must be able to document that they have enough funding to live in Norway while attending university.

   The Norwegian immigration authorities will not issue a student residence permit without proof that you have the funds needed to live here. For the 2012-2013 academic year, the minimum amount
   that you must document for the authorities is NOK 92,500 (approximately        US$ 16,000).

   4. What are the costs of living like in Trondheim and Norway??

   There is a one word answer to this: expensive! But to be more specific, you should probably budget about NOK 9,200 per month to cover your basic costs, such as housing, food and other
   university expenses. In fact, this is why the Norwegian government requires students to demonstrate that they have funds of NOK 92,500 (in 2012-2013) before a student residence permit is
   issued. Your single biggest expense will be housing, which is typically between NOK 4000 and NOK 4500, or more, depending upon whether  you live in a little room or something a little larger.

   Many students rent a "hybel", which is a bed-sit (UK English) or a studio apartment (American English). This is often a room in someone's home, typically in the basement (but with windows) and
   with its own entry.

   Food is also very expensive, since most of it must come from outside of Norway. But since there are no tuition expenses in Norway, you have to look at the overall costs of your education in
   that context.

   5. Can I get an undergraduate degree at NTNU if I don't speak Norwegian?

   In a word, no. Nearly all undergraduate level classes are instructed in Norwegian. But if you really want to earn your undergraduate degree here, you can take Norwegian classes at NTNU that
   will eventually enable you to study in Norwegian.

   6. Do I have to speak Norwegian to get a master's or PhD degree at NTNU?

   No. NTNU offers a range of international master's programmes and PhD programmes in English. But you will have to demonstrate that you are proficient in English if you come from a country where
   English is not a native language.

   7. What are the application deadlines?

   The application deadline varies depending on the programme:
     * Exchange students : May 1 for the autumn semester, October 1 for the spring semester.
     * IFUS applicants: December 1 of the year before you intend to start your studies.
     * International master's programmes: December 1 of the year before you intend to start your studies. Final application deadline: February 1.
     * Applicants with a Norwegian or Nordic Degree have a deadline of April 15.
     * Ordinary undergraduate degree programmes taught in Norwegian: Application to the Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service (NUCAS) by March 1 of the same year that you intend to
       start your studies.
     * PhD programmes: The deadlines vary depending upon the individual vacancies, but are typically early in the year for a programme beginning in the autumn.

   8. What do I do if I want to study at NTNU as an exchange student?

   If you want to become an exchange student at NTNU, you have to fill in the application form on our website. The application deadline is May 1 for the autumn semester, and October 1 for the
   spring semester. After you have filled in the form and sent it electronically, you must print it, sign it and send it to us in the post with your transcripts. You can also browse a complete
   list of course descriptions on our website to help you decide what to study while here.

   9. What do I do if I want to study at NTNU as an undergraduate student?

   First, you have to learn Norwegian if it's not your native language -- it's one of the primary admissions requirements. Note that native speakers of Finnish, Swedish and Danish do not have to
   meet the Norwegian language requirement. We offer a one-year full-time course in Norwegian called IFUS for students who would like to study at NTNU but don't know the language. The course
   starts in August every year, but the application deadline is December 1 of the year before you intend to start your studies. After you have passed the Norwegian course, you may continue to
   study at NTNU within your chosen field.

   If you can document your knowledge of Norwegian, you should apply through the Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service (NUCAS). The application deadline for applicants with a
   foreign educational background is March 1 of the same year you intend to start your studies.

   10. What do I do if I want to study at NTNU as a master's student?

   NTNU currently offers more 30 international master's programmes. These programmes are open to applicants who have a bachelor's degree or equivalent in an academic area that is relevant to the
   programme they wish to pursue at NTNU. If you are either employed or a student at one of NTNU's collaborating institutions in Africa, Asia, the Palestinian Areas or Central- and Eastern Europe,
   you may be eligible for a loan and scholarship through the Quota Scheme.

   The Norwegian Agency for International Cooperation and Development also may be a source of funding through the NOMA programme. All master's programmes start in August, and there is no admission
   for the spring semester. For both Quota Scheme applicants and applicants with individual funding, the preliminary application deadline is December 1, with the final application deadline of
   February 1 for applicants who have passed preliminary screening.

   11. What do I do if I want to study at NTNU as a PhD student?

   If you intend to come to NTNU as a PhD candidate, you are advised to contact the relevant Faculty directly. Please see our website on or a list of all faculties and departments at NTNU. You
   should also check our listing of vacant positions. There are no fixed deadlines for PhD applicants, and applications may be submitted at any time, although clearly if you're applying for a
   vacancy, you'll want to adhere to the deadlines in the description.

   12. Do you offer Norwegian courses?

   We do. We have an intensive summer course that lasts for 3-4 weeks, courses that run for the whole semester (you have to pass three semesters to meet NTNU's language requirements) and a
   year-long intensive Norwegian course that upon successful completion meets NTNU's Norwegian requirements. The intensive summer course is mainly intended for exchange students or master's or PhD
   students who are coming to NTNU in the autumn semester and need to learn some Norwegian first, whereas the semester course is intended for students/ employees at NTNU who are staying in Norway
   for some time.Everyone with a residence permit in Norway may apply for this course, however, and some places are reserved for applicants that are not connected to NTNU.

   You can find more information about these courses on our website.

   13. I can't find what I am looking for!

   If all else has failed, you can check the sitemap.

   14.Where do I find course descriptions (ECTS information) ?

   We maintain a list and descriptions of all courses offered at the university, organized by topic.

   15. Where can I find practical information about living in Trondheim?

   We have compiled a range of useful information on our Living in Trondheim webpages.

   16. What do I do about housing for my stay at NTNU?

   All students who have applied for an exchange period at NTNU will receive information about housing from the Office of International Relations. Unfortunately, NTNU cannot guarantee housing for
   all incoming exchange students, although there are programmes in Trondheim to help as described below. Exchange students from countries outside of the EU/EEA are guaranteed housing due to visa
   regulations. Students from within the EU/EEA will be informed when their application to become an exchange student has been processed.

   17. When does the semester start and when are the exam periods?

   Because the dates change from year to year, the easiest way to answer is to have you look at the current calendar.

   18. I need help with my application or I want to know if I have a chance to be accepted to your university! Can you answer specific questions about my application?

   In a word, no. We literally have thousands of applicants every year from around the globe, so we unfortunately cannot offer individual help or guidance to everyone who needs it. We have tried
   to make our webpages as comprehensive as possible, and we believe that you should be able find the information you need on our website. Good luck!

Exchange students

   Illustrasjonsbilde/FOTO

   student exchange and placement programmes, such as the Erasmus programme and the Leonardo da Vinci programme. Others are operated in conjunction with other Nordic countries (NORDPLUS).

   Exchange students who come to NTNU from abroad typically attend the university for short periods of between 3-12 months and return to their home university at the end of the exchange period.

   If your university does not have a formal exchange agreement with NTNU, you may apply to study at NTNU for a maximum of one academic year as a Free Mover.

Norwegian language courses at NTNU

   Living in Norway gives you an unparalleled opportunity to learn Norwegian. NTNU offers both full-time and part-time classes to help you learn Norwegian as a second language.

   Dragvoll Campus at NTNU Our full-time programme is called IFUS and admits 20 students each autumn. The programme is primarily intended for students who come directly from abroad, and who plan
   to go on to regular studies at NTNU that are taught in Norwegian.
   Our part-time programme, called Norwegian for Foreigners (or Norwegian as a second language) admits about 180 students each semester. It is comprised of courses at four different levels.
   Successful completion of level 3 fulfils the Norwegian language requirement for admission to NTNU and most studies at other universities and colleges. We also offer an intensive course in late
   summer for exchange students.

   Check our chart to see which course works for you:

Norwegian language courses at NTNU

   Living in Norway gives you an unparalleled opportunity to learn Norwegian. NTNU offers both full-time and part-time classes to help you learn Norwegian as a second language.

   Dragvoll Campus at NTNU Our full-time programme is called IFUS and admits 20 students each autumn. The programme is primarily intended for students who come directly from abroad, and who plan
   to go on to regular studies at NTNU that are taught in Norwegian.
   Our part-time programme, called Norwegian for Foreigners (or Norwegian as a second language) admits about 180 students each semester. It is comprised of courses at four different levels.
   Successful completion of level 3 fulfils the Norwegian language requirement for admission to NTNU and most studies at other universities and colleges. We also offer an intensive course in late
   summer for exchange students.

   Check our chart to see which course works for you:

IFUS admission requirements

   General Requirements
   IFUS minimum admission requirements vary depending upon your home country and native language. NTNU follows the national guidelines offered by the GSU-list.

   You must also fulfil the university's English language requirements. If you come from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, or Vietnam and have a BA/BSc/BEng degree where
   English was the language of instruction, you still must prove that you meet the English language requirements (unless you received a BA degree in English).

   If you meet these minimum entrance requirements, and can document sufficient funding, we will evaluate you for admission to the programmes you would like to attend after IFUS. You will be
   competing for a spot with other applicants to the programmes of your choice, so a competitive grade point average is a great advantage. Once you have completed the IFUS programme, your
   conditional acceptance status will be converted to regular admission.

   Financial requirements
   As an applicant to IFUS, you have to document that you have enough money to support yourself during your studies in Norway. The immigration authorities currently require a minimum of NOK 89 000
   per year for each year of study.

   Individual education plan requirement
   You must also identify at least three alternative choices for your post-IFUS studies. The Office of International Relations will make every effort to grant you your first choice. Remember,
   though, we have to compare your qualifications with the requirements for the individual courses, and you must also compete with Norwegian applicants for places in courses with restricted
   admissions. If we can't offer you a place in any of the study alternatives you chose, then we will have to reject your application to the IFUS programme as well.

   Additionally, you cannot apply to International Masters programmes, medicine or the professional studies in psychology, music and fine arts through the IFUS program.

IFUS - Application process for students residing abroad

   If you want to apply for the Introductory Program in the Norwegian Language (IFUS), you must use the preliminary application form . The application form will be online in the end of October.The
   deadline for applying is December 1st for admission in the following year.

   STEP 1: Complete PRELIMINARY application form
   1. Do not submit any documentation with your preliminary application. Since the program is highly competitive, it is important to fill in all sections of the form. Failure to give details about
   how you will finance your studies or the study programme you would like to pursue after IFUS will result in rejection.

   2. Await a written response from the initial screening (Dec. /Jan.).

   The screening process generally takes place in late December. Final application forms are sent out in December/January to qualified candidates. All incomplete applications or unqualified
   applicants will receive a standard rejection letter giving the main reasons for the rejection.

   3. Make arrangements, if necessary, to take the TOEFL test or the IELTS test or equivalent. Most applicants have to take this test to document English proficiency. The only exemptions are
   listed here

   STEP 2: Complete FINAL application
   1. The application deadline for the final application form is February 15th .

   2. The application should include at least three alternative choices of study.

   3. Certified copies of transcripts and diplomas starting with secondary school, should be included.

   4. The application should also include documented proof of funding.

   5. Proof of sufficient knowledge of English is required, preferably by taking the TOEFL or IELTS test. Note that the result of the TOEFL test has to be sent directly from ETS or British Council
   to the Office of International Relations in order to be accepted.

   STEP 3: Await result
   1. ACCEPTANCE LETTER: The best candidates for the IFUS program are selected and sent a letter of admission, usually at the end of April, beginning of May.

   2. WAITING LIST: Other highly qualified candidates will be put on the waiting list and notified in the case of a vacancy.

   3. UNQUALIFIED APPLICANTS: Applicants with grades or education that are insufficient for admission into the program of their choice or those who did not submit all the necessary information
   receive a rejection letter.

   STEP 4: Apply for residence permit
   Accepted candidates must apply for their residence permit through the Norwegian embassy or consulate in their home country. The coordinator at NTNU's Office of International Relations will
   supply the Norwegian immigration authorities with the names of all selected candidates to the IFUS program, and keep in contact with the immigration authorities to ensure that all the
   candidates receive their residence permits in time.

   NOTE: Students coming from countries that require visa for entry, cannot enter Norway until AFTER they have received their residence permit.

   STEP 5: Orientation
   SEMESTER START

   The semester usually begins between the 16th and 20th of August. It is crucial that the students arrive before lectures begin. Students who arrive more than two weeks after the semester starts
   usually lose their place in the program.

   ORIENTATION WEEK

   The Office of International Relations arranges an orientation week for all new international students in the Fall semester. This usually takes place the week before lectures begin. We strongly
   recommend that you participate in this week. It gives a lot of important and necessary information as well as an opportunity to meet other international students before the semester begins.

Application

   The preliminary application form can be downloaded from the following web page:
     * Preliminary Application - IFUS

   New application material is made available in late October each year and the preliminary application form is only made available online. Make sure that you fill in all the necessary information
   before you click on the send icon. Note that it is no longer necessary to send a hard copy of the preliminary application form.

   Please, submit only one application. We will only process one application per person. Applicants with more than one application, will only have their last submitted application considered.

   Note: Submissions made on application forms from previous years are NOT processed. If you want your application processed you must use the current application form.

   The final application form is only sent to the qualified applicants from the preliminary application process. It is therefore not available online.

   STEP 2: Complete FINAL application
   1. The application deadline for the final application form is February 15th .

   2. The application should include at least three alternative choices of study.

   3. Certified copies of transcripts and diplomas starting with secondary school, should be included.

   4. The application should also include documented proof of funding.

   5. Proof of sufficient knowledge of English is required, preferably by taking the TOEFL or IELTS test. Note that the result of the TOEFL test has to be sent directly from ETS or British Council
   to the Office of International Relations in order to be accepted.

   STEP 3: Await result
   1. ACCEPTANCE LETTER: The best candidates for the IFUS program are selected and sent a letter of admission, usually at the end of April, beginning of May.

   2. WAITING LIST: Other highly qualified candidates will be put on the waiting list and notified in the case of a vacancy.

   3. UNQUALIFIED APPLICANTS: Applicants with grades or education that are insufficient for admission into the program of their choice or those who did not submit all the necessary information
   receive a rejection letter.

   STEP 4: Apply for residence permit
   Accepted candidates must apply for their residence permit through the Norwegian embassy or consulate in their home country. The coordinator at NTNU's Office of International Relations will
   supply the Norwegian immigration authorities with the names of all selected candidates to the IFUS program, and keep in contact with the immigration authorities to ensure that all the
   candidates receive their residence permits in time.

   NOTE: Students coming from countries that require visa for entry, cannot enter Norway until AFTER they have received their residence permit.

   STEP 5: Orientation
   SEMESTER START

   The semester usually begins between the 16th and 20th of August. It is crucial that the students arrive before lectures begin. Students who arrive more than two weeks after the semester starts
   usually lose their place in the program.

   ORIENTATION WEEK

   The Office of International Relations arranges an orientation week for all new international students in the Fall semester. This usually takes place the week before lectures begin. We strongly
   recommend that you participate in this week. It gives a lot of important and necessary information as well as an opportunity to meet other international students before the semester begins.

Application

   The preliminary application form can be downloaded from the following web page:
     * Preliminary Application - IFUS

   New application material is made available in late October each year and the preliminary application form is only made available online. Make sure that you fill in all the necessary information
   before you click on the send icon. Note that it is no longer necessary to send a hard copy of the preliminary application form.

   Please, submit only one application. We will only process one application per person. Applicants with more than one application, will only have their last submitted application considered.

   Note: Submissions made on application forms from previous years are NOT processed. If you want your application processed you must use the current application form.

   The final application form is only sent to the qualified applicants from the preliminary application process. It is therefore not available online.

Intensive Norwegian Summer Courses for Exchange Students

- Summer 2012

   They are fun and challenging, and a way to make new friends and learn about a new culture: NTNU's intensive summer Norwegian courses are a great opportunity for exchange students who want to
   learn Norwegian.

   We offer two different course periods:
     * Course A:  Thursday, 26.7.2012 - 18.8.2012
     * Course B:  Monday, 30.7.2012 - 18.8.2012

   Both courses are organized by NTNU's Office of International Relations, and supported by the European Commission under the framework of the EILC programme. This means that you may only apply
   for EILC scholarships if you are a participant in the Erasmus programme. You should be able to obtain the necessary application forms from the International Office at your university. To be
   registered as an EILC applicant we must receive the electronic application form (see below), plus the EILC application form from your home institution. As an EILC applicant both document has to
   be sent in before the deadline.
   Students not applying for the EILC programme need only to send the print of the electronic application form.

   We welcome 180 students from all over the world with majority from EU countries. Please note that we cannot guarantee a place in the language course due to the large number of applicants. You
   will be notified about the results approximately one week after the registration deadline.

   NORWEGIAN - THE REAL EUROPEAN CHALLANGE:
   NTNU has a long tradition with exchange students following international master courses or doing their thesis work supervised by English-speaking professors. But to get most out of a stay in
   Norway, you have to learn the language. The summer intensive course is exactly what its name suggests --INTENSIVE -- and the pace is very fast.

   The programme
   The language course is comprised of a total of 70 hours of training. You also work with your fellow students in self-study groups on different language tasks. Because of the high-speed progress
   it is extremely important that the participants take part from the very beginning. It is not possible to work part-time jobs during the course!

   Difference between course A and B:
   Both courses have the same amount of teaching hours (70) and the lectures will start at the same day. But course A gives you more time to socialise with your future fellow students, to start
   the first weekend with an exciting hiking trip and other social activities. It might also be easier to get cheaper tickets when you can avoid weekend arrivals.

   Our enthusiastic language team encourages you to participate in cultural and social events in Trondheim and our main focus is on out door activities. A small fee for the social programme
   enables you to learn more about your new study country.

   Course level/difficulty
   We offer 9 different groups. Each group has a maximum of about 20 students. In general courses start at the beginners level.  Two courses are reserved for students with some knowledge.

   Social programme
   The Office of International Relations offers a social programme, which includes "get-to-know" Trondheim activities, various dinners/barbecues, weekend and day trips in the surroundings of
   Trondheim and, of course, a lot of fun. Some of the activities can be challenging physically and will definitely need appropriate clothing and equipment.. The social programme is an integral
   part of the language course.

   Course fees

   Exchange students
   Course A: 650 NOK course fee and 750 NOK for the social programme. Total amount to pay: 1400 NOK
   Course B: 650 NOK course fee and 700 NOK for the social programme. Total amount to pay: 1350 NOK

   EILC students (EU language programme)
   Course A : Course participation free - social programme fee: 750 NOK. Total amount to pay: 750 NOK
   Course B : Course participation free - social programme fee: 700 NOK . Total amount to pay: 700 NOK

   The course fee does cover text books (NOK 450 ).

   The course has to be paid after arrival by bank transfer (no cash).

   Accomodation
   The Office of International Relations will arrange accommodation for you.

   For EILC students only: Please make sure that all necessary information has reached our office before the deadline (web registration plus official EILC application form)

Education plan changes

   Choosing your plan of study at NTNU is important for many reasons -- but one of the most important is that it can be very difficult to make changes after you've been accepted.

   When you are admitted to the IFUS programme, you are also accepted to a specific programme of study for a specified length of time. Unfortunately, if you change your mind it can be quite
   difficult to alter your study plans -- changes usually are denied. It is therefore important that you carefully consider your application choices.

   Your Norwegian residence permit is granted on the basis of an "Admission Letter". Any changes made to the education plan or length of study time may therefore jeopardize this permit. Any
   changes to the education plan must be approved by the Office of International Relations, and will normally come only as a result of an evaluation of previous education.

   If you decide to change your education plan, contact the coordinator at the Office of International Relations as soon as possible. The coordinator will carefully go through your plans with you,
   and if they are acceptable recommend that your student permit is extended. Note that such changes usually require that the student applies through NUCAS (the Norwegian Universities and Colleges
   Admission Service, or Samordnet Opptak).

   Credit transfer
   Please note that the Norwegian academic system and the NTNU grading system may differ from what you are used to in your home country. This might complicate credit transfer matters and it is
   therefore extremely important that you consider this in your plans for study at NTNU. The Office of International Relations will guide all students accepted to the IFUS program through the
   process of evaluation and in drawing up the final education plan upon arrival.

Faculty of Humanities

   The Faculty of Humanities at NTNU is both a Faculty within the tradition of human sciences and a Faculty that is a humanistic force within the main profile of technology and natural sciences
   specific for NTNU.

   As part of a university with Technology and Natural Sciences as its main profile, the Faculty of Humanities aims to contribute with the humanistic perspectives necessary for the understanding
   of the role of Technology in society and of technology as a product of culture.
   Through the Humanities' emphasis on reflection and critical thinking, the Faculty's aim is to contribute to NTNU's development of its role as an educational and research institution, in close
   dialogue with society, culture, industry and commerce.
   The Faculty is responsible for teaching and research within a broad range of subjects in the Humanities: Language and Communication, History, Culture, Religion, Philosophy, Literature and Art.
   Furthermore, as a result of the university's main profile the Faculty aims to develop existing programmes of study in the intersection between technology and the Humanities, such as music
   technology and language technology and also to establish new study programmes with an interdisciplinary focus.

Studies

   The Faculty of Humanities offers a broad and attractive range of subjects, which include discipline-based and inter-disciplinary research and programmes of study. Our academic provision also
   includes international master's programmes.

   The Faculty of Humanities offers programmes of study at bachelor's and master's level. These include:
     * International master's programmes:
          + Master of Philosophy (M. Phil.) in Linguistics
          + M. Phil. in English Linguistics and Language Acquistion
          + Choreomundus - International master in Dance Knowledge, Practice, and Heritage
          + Nordic Master of Arts in Dance Studies (NO-MA-DS)
     * Semester programme in English aimed at exchange students (autumn semester).

     * Courses taught in a non-Norwegian language 2012/2013

     * Integrated interdisciplinary programmes of study at bachelor's level

     * Specialisations at Bachelor's level

     * 1-year programmes (Bachelor's level)

     * Master's programmes (2 years)

     * Language Studies with Teacher Education (Master's degree (5 years) with specializations in Norwegian. English, French or German

     * History Studies with Teacher Education (Master's degree (5 years)

   The Faculty of Humanities has a considerable breadth within research and teaching, which comprises language and literature, History and Philosophy, Musicology and Dance Studies. Research is the
   foundation for our programmes of study, and is specially reflected in advanced courses.

   Some programmes of study are interdisciplinary, such as Cultural Heritage and Music Technology, and consist of courses from several disciplines. Others also have a professional or applied
   orientation, which differentiates them from the more traditional subject-based programmes of study.

   Furthermore, the Faculty enjoys a broad activity within the practical aesthetic field, especially within the Department of Music and the Department of Art and Media Studies. Through the
   Performing Music Studies, Music Technology, Drama and Theatre and the Media Production Studies, our students and lecturers are actively participating in the vibrant culture life in Trondheim.

   Several courses and some programmes of study within language and literature, as well as the master's programmes in Globalization, Linguistics, English and Applied Ethics are taught in English.
   Furthermore, both Norwegian and international students populate the courses and programmes of study, which contributes to create an international study environment.

Course in Academic Writing for exchange students at the Faculty of Humanities - Autumn 2012

   Writing is an integral part of an academic education. The Faculty of Humanities therefore offers a course in academic writing: SPRÅK1501 Academic Writing (7.5 ECTS).

   The purpose of this writing course is to introduce students to the main types of academic writing they will be expected to do while they are studying at NTNU.

   SPRÅK1501 Academic Writing is part of the Faculty's semester programme for international students.

   The course will cover the basic structures of term papers and other types of academic writing, with focus on establishing the rationale and purpose of an academic paper. Since academic writing
   is dependent on the research of others, the course will emphasize the importance of finding, evaluating and referring to relevant literature. Reference is a key issue here. In addition, the
   course will provide students with writing and language techniques that are useful in writing a clear, coherent, logical text.

   The course will be instructed in English and will be a combination of lectures and student participation (group work).

   The course awards 7.5 ECTS credits, and is offered in the autumn semester. The timetable is available here.

Exam registration 2010-2011

   All students at NTNU register for their exams at the Student Web. This includes exchange students at NTNU.

   any questions, we ask you to contact The Office of International Relations, who provides practical and technical assistance to exchange students.

Information about Academic misconduct and Plagiarism

   NTNU's Instructive guidelines for the management of academic misconduct/attempted academic misconduct in examinations at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) (hereafter
   abbreviated Instructive guidelines) emphasize the seriousness of academic misconduct and plagiarism.

   NTNU regards academic misconduct/plagiarism as a serious breach of trust and unjust to fellow students. This will be taken into account in all procedures for cases of academic misconduct or
   plagiarism.


What is academic misconduct?

    1. Academic misconduct in traditional written examinations in an examination room involves the use of unauthorized items or texts during the examination. When this type of academic misconduct
       is found, there is rarely any doubt as to this being academic misconduct or attempted academic misconduct.
    2. After the introduction of the Quality Reform which emphasizes other forms of assessment such as term papers, semester assignments/take-home examinations, academic misconduct primarily
       refers to plagiarism - the dishonest use of sources, particularly the Internet.

   It is important to distinguish between academic misconduct and a paper falling below minimal standard of academic acceptability. For example, copying long paragraphs without referring to
   sources will be an evident case of academic misconduct.


   Students shall be offered information about the proper use of sources and references as well as how to search for information. Students are also to be informed about the implications of group
   work and the requirements set in this connection compared with independent work. At the same time, students are required to ensure that they stay informed about the requirements set for
   individual work.


   In 2004 NTNU launched a new learning tool - VIKO, Your guide to information literacy. This offer is primarily intended for undergraduates at Bachelor's level who are writing their first
   semester assignment/semester paper/term paper. However, VIKO is also a useful tool of reference for students at higher levels. VIKO is an interactive course in information literacy developed
   for students at NTNU. This learning device consists of seven units designed to be used as tools when searching for information as a part of academic writing. VIKO offers help in finding
   literature, assessing the quality of information and sources, writing papers and listing references. VIKO is designed as a course with teaching material and pertaining exercises designed to
   test your recently acquired knowledge and skills. Please note that VIKO is social-scientifically oriented, but is nevertheless a useful tool for students within the Humanities as well.


Procedure for cases of academic misconduct or plagiarism

   Act relating to Universities and Colleges (Norwegian Universities' Act) includes regulations about penalties for students who are found guilty of academic misconduct or plagiarism. The Act
   proposes two possible sanctions:
    1. Students who are found guilty of academic misconduct or plagiarism will have their examination papers declared null and void (Norwegian Universities' Act, Section 54, subsections 1a and
       1b). In the Instructive guidelines the annulment is regarded as the mildest form of reaction. Annulment does not require evidence that the student intended to commit and examination offence
       or plagiarize.
    2. Students who are found guilty of academic misconduct or plagiarism are denied the right to sit their exams, their examination papers are declared null and void, and they are excluded from
       all educational institutions affected by the Norwegian Universities' Act for a maximum of one year (Norwegian Universities' Act, Section 42, subsection 3). This type of reaction requires
       evidence that the student either intended to commit an examination offence or plagiarize or is guilty of gross negligence. Students who are found guilty of academic misconduct or plagiarism
       are deprived of all their rights as students for the duration of the penalty. This includes denied access to all teaching and instruction, computer laboratories and reading rooms, blocking
       of admission cards and they will not receive either a bank giro to pay their tuition fees or a semester card.

The procedure in cases of suspected academic misconduct or plagiarism has several stages:

    1. In connection with home examinations and term papers any suspicion of plagiarism usually first arises with the external examiner or the subject teacher. The Department refers cases on
       suspected plagiarism to the Faculty. On suspicion of academic misconduct in examinations in the examination room, the invigilators will report to the Examination Office. These cases are
       usually not brought to the Department/Faculty. The remaining procedure is identical to that of other cases of suspected academic misconduct or plagiarism.
    2. The Central Complaints Board is the only authority that can reach a decision of annulment or exclusion. The Complaints Board consists of five persons and is headed by a district judge.
       There are also two academic staff members and two students on the Board. In cases of academic misconduct/attempted academic misconduct the Complaints Board can annul the evaluation
       (Norwegian Universities' Act, Section 54). Further more, the Board can exclude a student that has commited an examination offence/attempted to commit academic misconduct for up to one year.
       The student can also lose his or her right to sit examinations at institutions under this Act for up to one year (Norwegian Universities' Act, Section 42, subsection 3).

Instructive guidelines for processing cases that fail to meet minimum academic standards

   Background

   In a meeting on 20 June 2005 the Heads of Department adopted the Faculty of Humanities' (formerly: the Faculty of Arts) plan against academic misconduct/plagiarism. The plan is an intergrated
   part of the Faculty's action plan as well as the Quality Assurance System.

   As part of this plan, instructions for the Departments have been prepared relating to the difference between academic misconduct/plagiarism and occurrences of assignments/papers that fall below
   minimal standard of academic acceptability which is not necessarily academic misconduct/plagiarism, and proposals of potential sanctions in cases that are not classified as academic misconduct
   or plagiarism.

   One of the main objectives of this work is to develop a common practice when treating various types of poor scholarship to the extent possible considering the several different forms of
   assessment and academic traditions.

   During the entire process of developing a plan to reduce the occurrence of plagiarism and academic misconduct, emphasis has been placed on increasing the students' ethical consciousness
   pertaining to academic work. It is important to have good routines that will reveal occurrences of poor scholarship such as plagiarism or lacking or poor references. It is also important to
   have good routines for procedures in cases that do not classify as academic misconduct but fail to meet the requirements for academic work.


   What is academic misconduct?

   It is important to clarify what the laws and regulations define as academic misconduct, and is treated as cases of such. Being found guilty of academic misconduct will have serious consequences
   for the student involved. For this reason, strict requirements apply as to what can be defined as academic misconduct.

   Today, academic misconduct is to a large extent related to plagiarism or the use of sources without reference particularly when using the Internet. New methods of assessment also involve other
   types of activities, but we have chosen to focus on written assignments/tests, including the final written examination and larger written compulsory assignments.


   According to Act relating to Universities and Colleges (hereafter abbreviated Norwegian Universities' Act), only assignments/tests/exercises that count for the final grade and larger compulsory
   assignments can be subject to cases of academic misconduct. The Faculty of Arts has not given a definition of `larger compulsory assignments', but we have established a practice that defines
   papers of more than 8 to 10 pages as `large' in this connection. However, this rule is neither absolute nor normative. It is regarded as a guideline, and opens for the possibility of smaller
   papers being treated as larger compulsory assignments, if there are academically based reasons to do so. The general principle is that compulsory assignments are 'large' if there is only one
   such activity in the course, if at Master's level, and if the assignment includes major academic challenges.


   With a gradual transition, our scale ranges from obvious academic misconduct according to the law via poor scholarship to poor performance. Academic misconduct according to the Norwegian
   Universities' Act requires evidence that the student either wilfully used unauthorized items or texts or plagiarized other people's texts in order to obtain a higher grade, or committed such an
   offence with gross negligence, i.e. blameworthy conduct.


   Cases of academic misconduct are treated according to the adopted guidelines and are eventually discussed in NTNU's Appeals Committee. Norwegian Universities' Act, Section 42 subsection 3, and
   Section 54 subsections 1a and 1b, and Study regulations at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Section 36 (Norwegian only)


   Criteria for evaluation of sanctions for cases that do not classify as academic misconduct

   I. Type of assignment/test/activity


   Compulsory assignments

   Assignments/papers and other activities which need to be approved (not graded) before the student can sit his or her exams.

   Compulsory assignments (both written and oral) that do not count for the final grade are generally treated differently from activities that are graded. Compulsory assignments are part of the
   continuous assessment which is part of the student's learning environment. Hence, the objective is not as much to test the students' knowledge and skills as to provide learning and guidance.

   Please note that only larger compulsory assignments fall under the regulations governing academic misconduct even in cases of serious neglect.


   Graded activities

   Semester assignments/semester papers/term papers, take-home examinations and other activities that are graded and count in the final course assessment.

   Assignments that count in the final course evaluation are usually dealt with more seriously than compulsory assignments, but considerations may be made to the course level, the size of the
   assignment and how much it counts for the final grade.

   Please note that when it comes to activities that count in the final course evaluation, careful considerations must be made as to whether the neglect is so serious that it classifies as
   academic misconduct.


   II. Course level

   It is natural to react milder to occurrences of papers failing to meet minimal standards of documentation and independent work for students in the initial stage of their Bachelor's degree
   programme (basic level) than for students at Master's level. Occurrences of papers falling below a minimal standard of academic acceptability will also be dealt with differently if it is
   submitted at an early stage (basic level) of a major/specialization than at a later stage (intermediate level) of the same study. Later in a Bachelor's degree programme (e.g. at the
   intermediate level of the student's first or second major/specialization) it will not be natural to differentiate between students at the basic and intermediate levels. Requirements set for
   students at Master's level are higher regardless of where they are in their programme.

   III. Degree of neglect

   This is a matter of opinion. When it comes to plagiarism in examination papers, large parts of the paper must be a direct copy before the student is found guilty of committing an examination
   offence/academic misconduct. Attempts have been made to create tables where the percentage of plagiarized text is evaluated to reactions and sanctions. However, this approach very easily
   becomes too rigid, as considerations are not made for differences between subjects, levels and form of assessment. We rather ought to develop a common understanding of where to put the line
   between different sanctions based on experience and discussions.

   When evaluating the degree of neglect, another aspect which needs consideration is the degree of guidance and information the student has been offered regarding academic writing, including
   referencing.


   Sanctions

   The first element to consider is whether or not the case in question fulfils the Norwegian Universities' Act's requirements for academic misconduct:

   The assignment/test counts in the final assessment of the course (graded activity), or is a larger compulsory assignment.

   The offence is serious and wilful.

   In cases of academic misconduct, NTNU's Appeals Committee decides upon the reaction based on prevailing regulations (The Norwegian Universities' Act, Section 4, subsections 7 and 8, and Study
   regulations at NTNU and Instructive guidelines for the management of academic misconduct/attempted academic misconduct at NTNU)

   When it comes to other types of academic offences/poor scholarship we need to find other suitable sanctions:


   Activities counting for the final grade

   Regarding graded assignments, unacceptable standards of scholarship will be discovered by the examiner during the marking process. Assignments lacking documentation/references/bibliography may
   result in a lower grade; plagiarism (not to the extent that it classifies as academic misconduct) may result in a fail grade for failing to meet minimal standards of independent work. The
   academic environments take the level of study into account in these matters.

   Example of a potential problem:

   Is it reasonable to react milder to a smaller semester assignment of minor importance for the final grade and/or submitted at an early stage of the Bachelor's programme than to a home
   examination submitted late in the programme?


   Compulsory assignments that do not count for the final grade

   For compulsory assignments/assignments that do not count for the final grade, the situation is different. As already mentioned, the compulsory assignments are part of the continuous assessment
   which is part of the students learning environment. The main objective of these activities/assignments is not to test the students' knowledge and skills, but to provide learning and guidance.
   The reaction in this case may vary depending on the course level of the assignment, whether the assignment is one of several smaller assignments, and whether the student previously has been
   made aware of poor references in his or her papers. Hence, it is not obvious that a paper submitted at an early stage of the programme where the student quite clearly has copied a source
   without providing any reference will result in the student losing his/her right to sit the exam. It will be more suitable for the purpose to offer advice and give the student the opportunity to
   submit the paper once more. If this is one of several smaller assignments, it may be approved followed by advice and comments as to what must be improved before submitting the next paper.

   Students regard poor scholarship and academic offences which are not academic misconduct as unjust to fellow students, and they call for strict repercussions.


   Checklist and examples

   We have provided a checklist of different factors that should/ought to be taken into account when considering cases of academic misconduct or papers failing to meet standards of documentation
   and independent work. However, this list is neither complete nor absolute. Some departments or academic environments may even wish to include other categories.

   We would also like to point out that this is not meant to be rigid instructions, but rather guidelines for academic environments and departments in order to develop the most appropriate
   routines and procedures. Discussions related to this topic will be an important part of the work of a contact group. The contact group consists of the deputy heads, as well as one
   administrative member of staff from each department, which was established in the autumn semester of 2005 which gathers the persons in charge of this work from each department.

   The categories are not absolute. The academic environments are free to evaluate the division between assignments/tests that count to a higher or smaller degree for the final grade. There may be
   cases where a strict reaction is appropriate even though the assignment/test is of minor importance and vice versa. The line between more or less than 50 per cent is put to indicate that it may
   be useful to differentiate between important and less important activities as regarding the final course evaluation.


   Type of activity

   Each activity may be checked off more than once. It may for instance be important to check whether an assignment is a piece of individual work or a group assignment (working method), regardless
   which other category under `Type of Category' it belongs to.
     * One of several minor compulsory assignments - graded as pass/fail
     * A minor compulsory assignment - graded as pass/fail
     * Large compulsory assignment - graded as pass/fail
     * Graded assignment that amounts to less than 50 per cent of the final grade evaluation basis for the course/subject
     * Graded assignment that amounts to more than 50 per cent of the final grade evaluation basis for the course/subject
     * Take-home examination


   Working method

   In addition to the type of activity, the working method bears consequences for the reaction. Raising the students' consciousness related to what is expected from an individual paper versus
   group work is important. The students would like the academic environments to offer more courses in writing at all levels. Alternatively, lectures or group sessions at the Introductory level
   (Ex. Phil.) could be used to a higher degree as a writing course, where the students also will have an introduction to the requirements for a good academic paper presented by their own academic
   environment, and a follow-up throughout the programme.


     * Individual assignment
     * Group assignment

   Course level

   Here it will be appropriate to differentiate between the basic level and the intermediate level within the same subject specialization.
     * Early in the Introductory level (Ex. Phil./Ex. Fac.)
     * Later in the Introductory level (Ex. Phil./Ex. Fac.)
     * Early in the Bachelor's programme/basic level
     * Early in the Bachelor's programme/intermediate level
     * Late in the Bachelor's programme/second subject specialization/one-year study programme
     * Master's level


   Degree of the offence

   It is also appropriate to differentiate the degree of the offence:
     * Poor academic performance in terms of failing to meet set standards of academic acceptability.
     * Paper failing to meet minimal standards of documentation (when using sources references)
     * Partly copying/plagiarism
     * Academic misconduct/plagiarism: Clear cases of copying.
     * Was the student offered the necessary/adequate tuition in and information about the use of sources, references and other rules and standards for academic writing?


   Sanctions

   The sanctions will be evaluated in relation to the type of activity, the course level and the degree of the offence.
     * The student's work is approved
     * The student is called to a meeting and given the opportunity to submit a new assignment *)
     * Lower grade
     * The student's work is not approved/fail grade
     * Academic misconduct - treated according to standard procedures

   *) The departments need to decide to what extent they would prefer routines for submission of new assignments, including the number of new chances and deadlines. We do not recommend that
   students may sit their exams provided that they submit obligatory assignments after the examination; such cases require the students to give their written consent to their sitting their exams
   with reservations to the compulsory assignments being approved.


   Examples of how to make use of the checklist

   We have provided six examples below:


   If the following items are checked off
     * Minor compulsory assignment
     * Submitted early in the Bachelor's programme at the basic level
     * Clear case of plagiarism

   The case does not fall under the regulations governing academic misconduct (not a graded activity, not large enough compulsory assignment).


   Possible reaction

   The student is called to a meeting and given the opportunity to submit a new assignment.


   If the following items are checked off
     * Major compulsory assignment (usually from 8 to 10 pages or more, but could also be less for academic reasons)
     * Submitted early in the Bachelor's programme at basic level (usually the first and second semesters)
     * Clear case of plagiarism

   The case falls under the regulations governing academic misconduct (large compulsory assignment and serious offence).


   Possible reaction

   Academic misconduct

   Note: If the extent of the plagiarism is not large enough to classify as academic misconduct, or if other circumstances relating to the assignment makes a report about academic misconduct out
   of the question: The student is called to a meeting and given the opportunity to submit a new assignment. Alternatively, the assignment is awarded a fail grade, particularly if the student has
   received adequate information about academic writing and has been offered follow-up.


   If the following items are checked off
     * Minor compulsory assignment
     * Submitted late in the Bachelor's programme (e.g. at specialization level)
     * Careless and poor references

   The case does not fall under the regulations governing academic misconduct (not graded activity, not serious enough offence).


   Possible reaction

   Either:
   The student's work is not approved.

   Or:
   If this is the first of several minor assignments and the assignment otherwise is good, the academic environment may choose to approve the assignment after a meeting with the student. If the
   next compulsory assignment also is characterized by plagiarism, there is good cause to award a fail grade.


   If the following items are checked off
     * Graded assignment that amounts to less than 50 per cent of the final evaluation basis for the course/subject
     * Submitted early in the Bachelor's programme at basic level
     * Clear case of plagiarism

   The case falls under the regulations governing academic misconduct (graded activity, serious offence).


   Possible reaction

   Usually academic misconduct

   If the assignment is of minor importance to the final grade, considerations may be made to the early stage of the programme, particularly if the information about or training in the use of
   sources and academic work has been poor, and the result may be lower grade.


   If the following items are checked off
     * graded assignment that amounts to more than 50 per cent of the final evaluation basis for the course/subject
     * submitted early in the Bachelor's programme at basic level
     * careless use of sources, elements of plagiarism

   The case does not fall under the regulations governing academic misconduct (not serious enough offence).


   Possible reaction

   Low grade or fail grade. The later in the programme the assignment is submitted, the better reason to award a fail grade.

   Note: In cases where a low grade is the result of plagiarism/unacceptable academic standard, where an assignment fails to meet minimal standards of documentation and/or independent work, it is
   necessary to state this information in the argumentation for the grade.


   If the following items are checked off
     * Graded assignment that amounts to more than 50 per cent of the final evaluation for the course/subject
     * Submitted early in the Bachelor's programme at basic level
     * Clear case of plagiarism

   The case falls under the regulations governing academic misconduct (graded activity, serious offence).


   Possible reaction

Instructive guidelines for processing cases that fail to meet minimum academic standards

   Background

   In a meeting on 20 June 2005 the Heads of Department adopted the Faculty of Humanities' (formerly: the Faculty of Arts) plan against academic misconduct/plagiarism. The plan is an intergrated
   part of the Faculty's action plan as well as the Quality Assurance System.

   As part of this plan, instructions for the Departments have been prepared relating to the difference between academic misconduct/plagiarism and occurrences of assignments/papers that fall below
   minimal standard of academic acceptability which is not necessarily academic misconduct/plagiarism, and proposals of potential sanctions in cases that are not classified as academic misconduct
   or plagiarism.

   One of the main objectives of this work is to develop a common practice when treating various types of poor scholarship to the extent possible considering the several different forms of
   assessment and academic traditions.

   During the entire process of developing a plan to reduce the occurrence of plagiarism and academic misconduct, emphasis has been placed on increasing the students' ethical consciousness
   pertaining to academic work. It is important to have good routines that will reveal occurrences of poor scholarship such as plagiarism or lacking or poor references. It is also important to
   have good routines for procedures in cases that do not classify as academic misconduct but fail to meet the requirements for academic work.


   What is academic misconduct?

   It is important to clarify what the laws and regulations define as academic misconduct, and is treated as cases of such. Being found guilty of academic misconduct will have serious consequences
   for the student involved. For this reason, strict requirements apply as to what can be defined as academic misconduct.

   Today, academic misconduct is to a large extent related to plagiarism or the use of sources without reference particularly when using the Internet. New methods of assessment also involve other
   types of activities, but we have chosen to focus on written assignments/tests, including the final written examination and larger written compulsory assignments.


   According to Act relating to Universities and Colleges (hereafter abbreviated Norwegian Universities' Act), only assignments/tests/exercises that count for the final grade and larger compulsory
   assignments can be subject to cases of academic misconduct. The Faculty of Arts has not given a definition of `larger compulsory assignments', but we have established a practice that defines
   papers of more than 8 to 10 pages as `large' in this connection. However, this rule is neither absolute nor normative. It is regarded as a guideline, and opens for the possibility of smaller
   papers being treated as larger compulsory assignments, if there are academically based reasons to do so. The general principle is that compulsory assignments are 'large' if there is only one
   such activity in the course, if at Master's level, and if the assignment includes major academic challenges.


   With a gradual transition, our scale ranges from obvious academic misconduct according to the law via poor scholarship to poor performance. Academic misconduct according to the Norwegian
   Universities' Act requires evidence that the student either wilfully used unauthorized items or texts or plagiarized other people's texts in order to obtain a higher grade, or committed such an
   offence with gross negligence, i.e. blameworthy conduct.


   Cases of academic misconduct are treated according to the adopted guidelines and are eventually discussed in NTNU's Appeals Committee. Norwegian Universities' Act, Section 42 subsection 3, and
   Section 54 subsections 1a and 1b, and Study regulations at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Section 36 (Norwegian only)


   Criteria for evaluation of sanctions for cases that do not classify as academic misconduct

   I. Type of assignment/test/activity


   Compulsory assignments

   Assignments/papers and other activities which need to be approved (not graded) before the student can sit his or her exams.

   Compulsory assignments (both written and oral) that do not count for the final grade are generally treated differently from activities that are graded. Compulsory assignments are part of the
   continuous assessment which is part of the student's learning environment. Hence, the objective is not as much to test the students' knowledge and skills as to provide learning and guidance.

   Please note that only larger compulsory assignments fall under the regulations governing academic misconduct even in cases of serious neglect.


   Graded activities

   Semester assignments/semester papers/term papers, take-home examinations and other activities that are graded and count in the final course assessment.

   Assignments that count in the final course evaluation are usually dealt with more seriously than compulsory assignments, but considerations may be made to the course level, the size of the
   assignment and how much it counts for the final grade.

   Please note that when it comes to activities that count in the final course evaluation, careful considerations must be made as to whether the neglect is so serious that it classifies as
   academic misconduct.


   II. Course level

   It is natural to react milder to occurrences of papers failing to meet minimal standards of documentation and independent work for students in the initial stage of their Bachelor's degree
   programme (basic level) than for students at Master's level. Occurrences of papers falling below a minimal standard of academic acceptability will also be dealt with differently if it is
   submitted at an early stage (basic level) of a major/specialization than at a later stage (intermediate level) of the same study. Later in a Bachelor's degree programme (e.g. at the
   intermediate level of the student's first or second major/specialization) it will not be natural to differentiate between students at the basic and intermediate levels. Requirements set for
   students at Master's level are higher regardless of where they are in their programme.

   III. Degree of neglect

   This is a matter of opinion. When it comes to plagiarism in examination papers, large parts of the paper must be a direct copy before the student is found guilty of committing an examination
   offence/academic misconduct. Attempts have been made to create tables where the percentage of plagiarized text is evaluated to reactions and sanctions. However, this approach very easily
   becomes too rigid, as considerations are not made for differences between subjects, levels and form of assessment. We rather ought to develop a common understanding of where to put the line
   between different sanctions based on experience and discussions.

   When evaluating the degree of neglect, another aspect which needs consideration is the degree of guidance and information the student has been offered regarding academic writing, including
   referencing.


   Sanctions

   The first element to consider is whether or not the case in question fulfils the Norwegian Universities' Act's requirements for academic misconduct:

   The assignment/test counts in the final assessment of the course (graded activity), or is a larger compulsory assignment.

   The offence is serious and wilful.

   In cases of academic misconduct, NTNU's Appeals Committee decides upon the reaction based on prevailing regulations (The Norwegian Universities' Act, Section 4, subsections 7 and 8, and Study
   regulations at NTNU and Instructive guidelines for the management of academic misconduct/attempted academic misconduct at NTNU)

   When it comes to other types of academic offences/poor scholarship we need to find other suitable sanctions:


   Activities counting for the final grade

   Regarding graded assignments, unacceptable standards of scholarship will be discovered by the examiner during the marking process. Assignments lacking documentation/references/bibliography may
   result in a lower grade; plagiarism (not to the extent that it classifies as academic misconduct) may result in a fail grade for failing to meet minimal standards of independent work. The
   academic environments take the level of study into account in these matters.

   Example of a potential problem:

   Is it reasonable to react milder to a smaller semester assignment of minor importance for the final grade and/or submitted at an early stage of the Bachelor's programme than to a home
   examination submitted late in the programme?


   Compulsory assignments that do not count for the final grade

   For compulsory assignments/assignments that do not count for the final grade, the situation is different. As already mentioned, the compulsory assignments are part of the continuous assessment
   which is part of the students learning environment. The main objective of these activities/assignments is not to test the students' knowledge and skills, but to provide learning and guidance.
   The reaction in this case may vary depending on the course level of the assignment, whether the assignment is one of several smaller assignments, and whether the student previously has been
   made aware of poor references in his or her papers. Hence, it is not obvious that a paper submitted at an early stage of the programme where the student quite clearly has copied a source
   without providing any reference will result in the student losing his/her right to sit the exam. It will be more suitable for the purpose to offer advice and give the student the opportunity to
   submit the paper once more. If this is one of several smaller assignments, it may be approved followed by advice and comments as to what must be improved before submitting the next paper.

   Students regard poor scholarship and academic offences which are not academic misconduct as unjust to fellow students, and they call for strict repercussions.


   Checklist and examples

   We have provided a checklist of different factors that should/ought to be taken into account when considering cases of academic misconduct or papers failing to meet standards of documentation
   and independent work. However, this list is neither complete nor absolute. Some departments or academic environments may even wish to include other categories.

   We would also like to point out that this is not meant to be rigid instructions, but rather guidelines for academic environments and departments in order to develop the most appropriate
   routines and procedures. Discussions related to this topic will be an important part of the work of a contact group. The contact group consists of the deputy heads, as well as one
   administrative member of staff from each department, which was established in the autumn semester of 2005 which gathers the persons in charge of this work from each department.

   The categories are not absolute. The academic environments are free to evaluate the division between assignments/tests that count to a higher or smaller degree for the final grade. There may be
   cases where a strict reaction is appropriate even though the assignment/test is of minor importance and vice versa. The line between more or less than 50 per cent is put to indicate that it may
   be useful to differentiate between important and less important activities as regarding the final course evaluation.


   Type of activity

   Each activity may be checked off more than once. It may for instance be important to check whether an assignment is a piece of individual work or a group assignment (working method), regardless
   which other category under `Type of Category' it belongs to.
     * One of several minor compulsory assignments - graded as pass/fail
     * A minor compulsory assignment - graded as pass/fail
     * Large compulsory assignment - graded as pass/fail
     * Graded assignment that amounts to less than 50 per cent of the final grade evaluation basis for the course/subject
     * Graded assignment that amounts to more than 50 per cent of the final grade evaluation basis for the course/subject
     * Take-home examination


   Working method

   In addition to the type of activity, the working method bears consequences for the reaction. Raising the students' consciousness related to what is expected from an individual paper versus
   group work is important. The students would like the academic environments to offer more courses in writing at all levels. Alternatively, lectures or group sessions at the Introductory level
   (Ex. Phil.) could be used to a higher degree as a writing course, where the students also will have an introduction to the requirements for a good academic paper presented by their own academic
   environment, and a follow-up throughout the programme.


     * Individual assignment
     * Group assignment

   Course level

   Here it will be appropriate to differentiate between the basic level and the intermediate level within the same subject specialization.
     * Early in the Introductory level (Ex. Phil./Ex. Fac.)
     * Later in the Introductory level (Ex. Phil./Ex. Fac.)
     * Early in the Bachelor's programme/basic level
     * Early in the Bachelor's programme/intermediate level
     * Late in the Bachelor's programme/second subject specialization/one-year study programme
     * Master's level


   Degree of the offence

   It is also appropriate to differentiate the degree of the offence:
     * Poor academic performance in terms of failing to meet set standards of academic acceptability.
     * Paper failing to meet minimal standards of documentation (when using sources references)
     * Partly copying/plagiarism
     * Academic misconduct/plagiarism: Clear cases of copying.
     * Was the student offered the necessary/adequate tuition in and information about the use of sources, references and other rules and standards for academic writing?


   Sanctions

   The sanctions will be evaluated in relation to the type of activity, the course level and the degree of the offence.
     * The student's work is approved
     * The student is called to a meeting and given the opportunity to submit a new assignment *)
     * Lower grade
     * The student's work is not approved/fail grade
     * Academic misconduct - treated according to standard procedures

   *) The departments need to decide to what extent they would prefer routines for submission of new assignments, including the number of new chances and deadlines. We do not recommend that
   students may sit their exams provided that they submit obligatory assignments after the examination; such cases require the students to give their written consent to their sitting their exams
   with reservations to the compulsory assignments being approved.


   Examples of how to make use of the checklist

   We have provided six examples below:


   If the following items are checked off
     * Minor compulsory assignment
     * Submitted early in the Bachelor's programme at the basic level
     * Clear case of plagiarism

   The case does not fall under the regulations governing academic misconduct (not a graded activity, not large enough compulsory assignment).


   Possible reaction

   The student is called to a meeting and given the opportunity to submit a new assignment.


   If the following items are checked off
     * Major compulsory assignment (usually from 8 to 10 pages or more, but could also be less for academic reasons)
     * Submitted early in the Bachelor's programme at basic level (usually the first and second semesters)
     * Clear case of plagiarism

   The case falls under the regulations governing academic misconduct (large compulsory assignment and serious offence).


   Possible reaction

   Academic misconduct

   Note: If the extent of the plagiarism is not large enough to classify as academic misconduct, or if other circumstances relating to the assignment makes a report about academic misconduct out
   of the question: The student is called to a meeting and given the opportunity to submit a new assignment. Alternatively, the assignment is awarded a fail grade, particularly if the student has
   received adequate information about academic writing and has been offered follow-up.


   If the following items are checked off
     * Minor compulsory assignment
     * Submitted late in the Bachelor's programme (e.g. at specialization level)
     * Careless and poor references

   The case does not fall under the regulations governing academic misconduct (not graded activity, not serious enough offence).


   Possible reaction

   Either:
   The student's work is not approved.

   Or:
   If this is the first of several minor assignments and the assignment otherwise is good, the academic environment may choose to approve the assignment after a meeting with the student. If the
   next compulsory assignment also is characterized by plagiarism, there is good cause to award a fail grade.


   If the following items are checked off
     * Graded assignment that amounts to less than 50 per cent of the final evaluation basis for the course/subject
     * Submitted early in the Bachelor's programme at basic level
     * Clear case of plagiarism

   The case falls under the regulations governing academic misconduct (graded activity, serious offence).


   Possible reaction

   Usually academic misconduct

   If the assignment is of minor importance to the final grade, considerations may be made to the early stage of the programme, particularly if the information about or training in the use of
   sources and academic work has been poor, and the result may be lower grade.


   If the following items are checked off
     * graded assignment that amounts to more than 50 per cent of the final evaluation basis for the course/subject
     * submitted early in the Bachelor's programme at basic level
     * careless use of sources, elements of plagiarism

   The case does not fall under the regulations governing academic misconduct (not serious enough offence).


   Possible reaction

   Low grade or fail grade. The later in the programme the assignment is submitted, the better reason to award a fail grade.

   Note: In cases where a low grade is the result of plagiarism/unacceptable academic standard, where an assignment fails to meet minimal standards of documentation and/or independent work, it is
   necessary to state this information in the argumentation for the grade.


   If the following items are checked off
     * Graded assignment that amounts to more than 50 per cent of the final evaluation for the course/subject
     * Submitted early in the Bachelor's programme at basic level
     * Clear case of plagiarism

   The case falls under the regulations governing academic misconduct (graded activity, serious offence).


   Possible reaction

   Academic misconduct

NTNU's Buddy programme for exchange students

   Exchange students at NTNU are offered to take part in the NTNU buddy scheme which is organized by ESN Trondheim. ESN Trondheim is a sub group within the international ERASMUS Student Network
   (ESN) organization.

   The Buddy programme at NTNU will help new international students to quickly become familar with the university. Each buddy group is led by a buddy. The buddy is a student him/herself, who will
   help new students in this respect.

   The buddy scheme is integrated in NTNU's Orientation Programme for exchange students.

   For additional information, please consult the International Office at NTNU.

NTNU's Buddy programme for exchange students

   Exchange students at NTNU are offered to take part in the NTNU buddy scheme which is organized by ESN Trondheim. ESN Trondheim is a sub group within the international ERASMUS Student Network
   (ESN) organization.

   The Buddy programme at NTNU will help new international students to quickly become familar with the university. Each buddy group is led by a buddy. The buddy is a student him/herself, who will
   help new students in this respect.

   The buddy scheme is integrated in NTNU's Orientation Programme for exchange students.

PhD

   The PhD education programme has the objective of training candidates to be independent researchers who can work at an international level in cooperation with Norwegian and international
   research groups.

   The Faculty of Humanities hosts four PhD programmes:
     * PhD programme in Interdisciplinary Studies of Culture
     * PhD programme in Historical and Cultural Studies
     * PhD programme in Humanities and the Arts
     * PhD programme in Language and Linguistics

   Follow the links to read about each programme. Or you may find more information about the PhD education at NTNU here.

   Dr.philos.
   If you have not been admitted to any of the PhD programmes you may still apply for the opportunity to submit a thesis for evaluation for the degree of dr.philos. A Norwegian doctoral degree is
   awarded as proof that the candidate's research qualifications are of a certain standard. The same standards apply for the research qualifications for a dr.philos. degree as for a PhD degree.
   This principle of equivalence refers to the academic standard and quality of the work submitted, not merely its scope. Since the degree of dr. philos. does not include an organized research
   training programme, the preparatory work (e.g. the collection of data) and the thesis itself are expected to be more extensive than that required in degrees with an organized research training
   programme. When assessing a doctoral thesis, special consideration is given to whether the thesis is an independent and comprehensive piece of work of high academic standard with regard to the
   formulation of research questions, methodological, theoretical and empirical bases, documentation, treatment of the literature and form of presentation in the thesis.
   The thesis and an application should be handed in to the research section at the Faculty of Humanities. If you have exams and degrees from other institutions than NTNU, authorized copies of
   documentation must be enclosed. We advise that you get in touch with the relevant department before handing in your thesis. More information can be found in the regulations concerning the
   dr.philos. degree.

Guidelines for Agreement Concerning Master's degree

   Guidelines for the Agreement Between Student and Home Department Concerning the Master's Degree - rights and duties

   1. The Master's programme agreement is a part of the student's individual education plan. The agreement is a binding contract regarding co-operation between the student, his/her academic
   supervisor and the Department, and it specifies the rights and duties that acceptance on to the Master's programme carries with it.

   2. Students who are admitted to a Master's programme are obliged to sign their Master's agreement and confirm their electronically based individual education plan by the relevant deadline (15
   September for students admitted in the autumn semester and 15 February for students admitted in the spring semester). A student's right to academic supervision and a personal or shared space in
   the reading rooms at Dragvoll is dependent upon the student having signed the agreement, confirmed his or her individual education plan each semester, and having paid the semester fee.

   3. The student's progression in relation to the nominal length of study must be specified in the agreement, and confirmed in the student's individual education plan. The agreed progression of
   study is based on the nominal length of two years of full-time study (30 ECTS credits per semester/60 ECTS credits per year). However, it is possible to apply for permission to study part time
   (we refer to Study regulations at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, § 8). This means that it is possible to complete the course of study as a part-time student with a maximum
   of four years of study). The time frame is stated in the Master's programme agreement and in the individual education plan. Students who fail to complete their course of study within this time
   frame without valid reason (valid reasons include illness and approved leave of absence) will have their place in the Master's programme withdrawn (see Study regulations at the Norwegian
   University of Science and Education, § 4 no. 5).

   4. Students are obliged to demonstrate progression in relation to the nominal length of study, unless they have been granted the right to study part-time. Leave of absence and part-time study
   can be approved following an application from the student (we refer to Study regulations at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, § 7). A student wishing to make such an
   application should submit it to his/her Department.

   5. Students are entitled to a total of 80 hours of academic supervision during their work with a Master's thesis that counts 60 credits. If the thesis counts fewer than 60 credits the number of
   hours allocated to academic supervision will be reduced according to the number of credits awarded for the thesis. The number of hours allocated to academic supervision is not related to
   whether or not the student completes the Master's programme within the nominal period of study. The time frame includes individual supervision as well as preparatory - and supplementary work
   for the supervisor. The estimated ratio for individual supervision vs. preparatory - and supplementary work is 1:4.

   6. During the course of the academic supervision of the Master's thesis the supervisor is specifically responsible for:
     * giving advice regarding framing and delimitation of the topic and approach to the problem
     * discussing and assessing hypotheses and methods
     * providing advice regarding professional literature, sources/data, as well as required resources
     * discussing matters of style, language, format and structure etc.
     * discussing results and their interpretation
     * ensuring that s/he is updated on the student's progress vis-a-vis the appointed time frame and progress schedule.
     * providing the student with information about ethical guidelines in relation to the work on the Master's thesis.

   7. If the academic supervisor is absent for a longer period of time as a result of research leave, illness or travel, the Department is responsible for appointing a new supervisor on the
   student's request.

   8. The student is responsible for allotting time for supervision within the time frame of the Master's agreement.

   9. The student is obliged to keep the academic supervisor and the Department updated on his or her academic progress. If s/he for some reason is forced to discontinue the course of study for a
   period of one semester or longer, this must be agreed and approved by the Department in advance. Part-time studies and leave of absence must be noted on the agreement form if applicable.

   10. If relations between the student and the supervisor become problematic for either the student or the supervisor, one or both of the parties may ask to be released from the academic
   supervision agreement. The Department is obliged to appoint a new supervisor if such a request is made.

   11. The Master's programme agreement must be monitored each semester in order to ensure that any required adjustments and changes to the agreement are made.

   12. In cases where the student submits a new thesis (if the primary thesis is not given a pass grade, see Study regulations at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, § 31), the
   student is obliged to enter into a new agreement with the Department, and this must be based on those changes and improvements to the thesis that are planned and approved.

Guidelines for Agreement Concerning Master's degree

   Guidelines for the Agreement Between Student and Home Department Concerning the Master's Degree - rights and duties

Research

   Humanistic research is concerned with most areas related to what it means to be human, and how human beings think about themselves and their surrounding environment.


   Humanistic research plays a key role in the welfare and development of Norway. Growth, the formation of knowledge and wealth creation are often tied to distinctive features of the Norwegian
   society: A high level of education, democracy and social stability. Humanistic perspectives and values are important elements in this picture. Through the development and use of basic
   scientific research, and through the diversity of professional perspectives, the humanities contribute with essential expertise in order to respond to the important challenges faced by society.

   The humanities is concerned with what it broadly means to be human; identity, language, historical context and values. Humanistic research deals with areas as varied as language comprehension,
   archaeological explorations of pre-historic societies, the meaning of religion and religious rituals, and definitions of what constitutes good art.


                                                                                                                                             ^The Research Council of Norway^, The science division:

Projects

   The Faculty of Humanities is involved in many different projects. The ones that have English-language websites are presented here. You will find more information about these and other projects
   by visiting the Departments' websites.

   Department of Philosophy

   Programme for Applied Ethics: An interdisciplinary programme that aims to develop the ethical competance among research staff and students.

   Department of Archaeology and Religious Studies

   European Forum for the Study of Religion and the Environment: A European co-operative project which promotes scholarly and critical inquiry into the relationships between human beings and their
   diverse cultures, environments and religious beliefs and practices.

   Creativity and Craft Production in Middle and Late Bronze Age Europe (CinBA): CinBA offers important insights into the fundamental nature of creativity by exploring a part of European history
   not influenced by contemporary concepts of art - the Bronze Age - looking at developments in crafts that we take for granted today: pottery, textiles and metalwork.

   Department of History and Classical Studies

   The Realm of Norway: The aim of the project, which is sponsored by the Norwegian Council of Research, is to undertake an analysis of the `Norgesveldet' as a political system. Our ambition is to
   study the Norwegian realm in the Middle Ages from a common Norse or West-Nordic perspective, and not a national one, be that Norwegian, Icelandic or Scottish or Swedish for that matter.

   Department of Modern Foreign Languages

   Exhibiting Europe. The Construction of European Integration and Identity in the Musée de l'Europe: Europe wants to be collected, but it has no collection. This tension serves as a starting
   point for the research project Exhibiting Europe. Taking into account the gap between ambition and the reality of a specific European narrative in museums, collections and exhibitions, our
   research addresses various topics.

   Translating cultures: Research group at the Department.

   Language and cognition: Language acquisition and language processing: Research group at the Department studying the relationship between language and cognition, i.e. how we learn languages -
   both first and second, how linguistic categories are formed and how we understand and process language.

   The Trondheim Forum for Eighteenth-Century Studies: Research group at the Department.

   Department of Music

   Jazz: The Jazz programme is part of the Music Performance programme.

   Department of Scandinavian Studies and Comparative Literature

   Transcultural aesthetics: The primary objectives of the project are to shed light on the dialogue between contemporary literature and central aspects of today's media culture, and to develop
   analytical tools that will better enable us to understand and describe the esthetic norms, values and positions that this literature conveys.

   Department of Language and Communication Studies

   Health communication: Research group at the Department. The aim is to consolidate discourse and communication research in the area of health communication in Norway.

   TypeCraft: TypeCraft is a multi-lingual on-line database of linguistically-annotated natural language text, embedded in a collaboration and information tool.

   Department of Interdisciplinary Cultural Studies

   The Department of Interdisciplinary Cultural Studies have several research groups that co-operate on larger and smaller research projects. Below you will find a list of these groups. You can
   find more information on specific projects on the groups' websites.

   Centre for Energy and Society

   Ethnicity, Gender and Gender Equality

   Health, Medicine and Biotechnology

   Sexuality, Gender and Culture

   Design, Culture, Consumption and Technology (IKON)

   The Faculty of Humanities is involved in many different projects. The ones that have English-language websites are presented here. You will find more information about these and other projects
   by visiting the Departments' websites.

   Department of Philosophy

   Programme for Applied Ethics: An interdisciplinary programme that aims to develop the ethical competance among research staff and students.

   Department of Archaeology and Religious Studies

   European Forum for the Study of Religion and the Environment: A European co-operative project which promotes scholarly and critical inquiry into the relationships between human beings and their
   diverse cultures, environments and religious beliefs and practices.

   Creativity and Craft Production in Middle and Late Bronze Age Europe (CinBA): CinBA offers important insights into the fundamental nature of creativity by exploring a part of European history
   not influenced by contemporary concepts of art - the Bronze Age - looking at developments in crafts that we take for granted today: pottery, textiles and metalwork.

   Department of History and Classical Studies

   The Realm of Norway: The aim of the project, which is sponsored by the Norwegian Council of Research, is to undertake an analysis of the `Norgesveldet' as a political system. Our ambition is to
   study the Norwegian realm in the Middle Ages from a common Norse or West-Nordic perspective, and not a national one, be that Norwegian, Icelandic or Scottish or Swedish for that matter.

   Department of Modern Foreign Languages

   Exhibiting Europe. The Construction of European Integration and Identity in the Musée de l'Europe: Europe wants to be collected, but it has no collection. This tension serves as a starting
   point for the research project Exhibiting Europe. Taking into account the gap between ambition and the reality of a specific European narrative in museums, collections and exhibitions, our
   research addresses various topics.

   Translating cultures: Research group at the Department.

   Language and cognition: Language acquisition and language processing: Research group at the Department studying the relationship between language and cognition, i.e. how we learn languages -
   both first and second, how linguistic categories are formed and how we understand and process language.

   The Trondheim Forum for Eighteenth-Century Studies: Research group at the Department.

   Department of Music

   Jazz: The Jazz programme is part of the Music Performance programme.

   Department of Scandinavian Studies and Comparative Literature

   Transcultural aesthetics: The primary objectives of the project are to shed light on the dialogue between contemporary literature and central aspects of today's media culture, and to develop
   analytical tools that will better enable us to understand and describe the esthetic norms, values and positions that this literature conveys.

   Department of Language and Communication Studies

   Health communication: Research group at the Department. The aim is to consolidate discourse and communication research in the area of health communication in Norway.

   TypeCraft: TypeCraft is a multi-lingual on-line database of linguistically-annotated natural language text, embedded in a collaboration and information tool.

   Department of Interdisciplinary Cultural Studies

   The Department of Interdisciplinary Cultural Studies have several research groups that co-operate on larger and smaller research projects. Below you will find a list of these groups. You can
   find more information on specific projects on the groups' websites.

   Centre for Energy and Society

   Ethnicity, Gender and Gender Equality

   Health, Medicine and Biotechnology

   Sexuality, Gender and Culture

   Design, Culture, Consumption and Technology (IKON)

   Tore Tingvold Petersen: Richard Nixon, Great Britain and the Anglo-American Alignment in the Persian Gulf and Arabian Peninsula: Making Allies out of Clients. Sussex Academic Press 2009,
   paperback 2011

   __________________________________________________________________
   Bokforside When the British Labour party announced the withdrawal of British forces from the Persian Gulf in January 1968, the United States faced a potential power vacuum in the area. The
   incoming Nixon administration, preoccupied with the Soviet Union and China, and the war in Vietnam, had no intention of replacing the British in the Gulf. To avoid further military commitments,
   the US encouraged Iran and Saudi Arabia to maintain area security. A critical policy decision, overlooked by most scholars, saw Nixon and Kissinger engineer the rise in oil prices between 1969
   and 1972 to enable Saudi Arabia and Iran to purchase the necessary military hardware to serve as guardians of the Gulf. For all their bluster about reversing Labour's withdrawal decision, after
   their surprise victory in the election of June 1970 the Conservatives adhered to Labour's policy. But in contrast to Labour's wish to cut the umbilical cord of empire, the Tories wanted to
   retain influence in the Persian Gulf, pursuing policies largely independent of the US by the creation of the United Arab Emirates, deposing the sultan of Oman, and trying to solve the dispute
   over the Buraimi oasis with Saudi Arabia. By trying to maintain its empire on the cheap, Britain turned into an arms supplier supreme. But offering and selling arms does not make a foreign
   policy, leaving Britain in the long run with less influence in regional affairs. This was true also for the US, whose arms sales were to prove no realistic an alternative to foreign policy.The
   US hid under the Iranian security blanket for almost a decade. Given the weakness of the regime and the Shah's nonsensical dreams of turning Iran into one of the top five industrial and
   military powers in the world, the policy was cavalierly irresponsible. Similarly, leaving Saudi Arabia wallowing in oil money and medieval stupor - a seedbed for Islamic fundamentalists -
   created major future problems for the United States, as evinced by 9/11.

   Truls Wyller: The Size of Things. Mentis Verlag 2010.

   _____________________________________________________

   Bokforside
   Taking as a point of departure the seemingly naïve question How big is a thing?, Wyller argues that the particular size of spatially extended objects can neither be an intrinsic property of
   objects nor a relation between physical objects. Similar to the particular duration of events, the size of spatially extended objects is accessible only to embodied subjects. Consequently,
   determinate extension in space and time is essentially indexical, inconceivable in a world without human beings.

   Sigurd Bergmann, Heather Eaton (eds.): Ecological Awareness Exploring Religion, Ethics and Aesthetics. LIT Verlag 2011

   ________________________________________________
   Bokforside The past years have seen an ecological development in religions that is staggering. These efforts are responses to difficult local and global ecological problems, with an increased
   awareness that religions need to be alert, engaged and active partners in the work for a sustainable future.
   Ecological Awareness - with 17 authors from theology, religious studies, biology, sociology and philosophy - explores how religious practitioners have become increasingly aware of ecological
   challenges. The book considers aspects of ecological awareness: personal, social, political, religious and ecological. It sheds new light on an essential function of belief systems, which
   function not only as cognitive and moral systems, but emerge from and affect our human body and its mode of perceiving our milieu and ourselves within it. The book contributes to an increasing
   awareness of our embeddedness in larger life processes, as well as the awareness of life as a gift.

PhD

   The PhD education programme has the objective of training candidates to be independent researchers who can work at an international level in cooperation with Norwegian and international
   research groups.

   The Faculty of Humanities hosts four PhD programmes:
     * PhD programme in Interdisciplinary Studies of Culture
     * PhD programme in Historical and Cultural Studies
     * PhD programme in Humanities and the Arts
     * PhD programme in Language and Linguistics

   Follow the links to read about each programme. Or you may find more information about the PhD education at NTNU here.

   Dr.philos.
   If you have not been admitted to any of the PhD programmes you may still apply for the opportunity to submit a thesis for evaluation for the degree of dr.philos. A Norwegian doctoral degree is
   awarded as proof that the candidate's research qualifications are of a certain standard. The same standards apply for the research qualifications for a dr.philos. degree as for a PhD degree.
   This principle of equivalence refers to the academic standard and quality of the work submitted, not merely its scope. Since the degree of dr. philos. does not include an organized research
   training programme, the preparatory work (e.g. the collection of data) and the thesis itself are expected to be more extensive than that required in degrees with an organized research training
   programme. When assessing a doctoral thesis, special consideration is given to whether the thesis is an independent and comprehensive piece of work of high academic standard with regard to the
   formulation of research questions, methodological, theoretical and empirical bases, documentation, treatment of the literature and form of presentation in the thesis.
   The thesis and an application should be handed in to the research section at the Faculty of Humanities. If you have exams and degrees from other institutions than NTNU, authorized copies of
   documentation must be enclosed. We advise that you get in touch with the relevant department before handing in your thesis. More information can be found in the regulations concerning the
   dr.philos. degree.

   Faculty of Humanities

Strategy for the Faculty of Humanities, 2012 - 2020

Vision

   The Faculty of Humanities (HF) should be a humanistic force in a technical and scientific university as well as in society at large and the realm of the arts and culture. HF will offer studies
   and conduct research in the core areas of the field. The faculty will also play an active role in the development of interdisciplinarity. Practical, aesthetic and artistic activities should be
   a central part of the faculty profile. The faculty's academic activities must also be of a quality that is recognized in its international academic peer relationships.

Values

   Summer at Dragvoll campus The Faculty of Humanities takes as its basic operating values the ideas of "creative, critical and constructive". The faculty will further the values of the European
   university tradition and promote knowledge, critical reflection, tolerance and fairness. All academic activities will be characterized by openness, curiosity and respect for other disciplines
   and traditions. The faculty will educate individuals to provide them insight and understanding, and the ability to undertake ethical reflection, to equip them with the ability to assume their
   local and global social responsibilities.

The Faculty of Humanities' social mission

   The academic activities of the faculty are based on strong academic disciplines. With this as its foundation, the faculty will execute its social mission by contributing to the development of
   democratic attitudes and understanding. We will prioritize outstanding professional work, interdisciplinarity and social relevance.
   Our multi-disciplinary environment in climate and energy research should be expanded to 2020, along with the disciplines of music technology, cultural heritage management and applied ethics.
   Our faculty has been central in the creation of these areas, and will continue to initiate the establishment of new ones. The five-year integrated teacher education programme is being fostered
   now and will be given priority in the future. We should also prepare for areas that have the potential for excellence beyond what we know today.

Research and artistic activities

   The faculty should contribute to the continuing development of national and international knowledge through international-level research and artistic activities. Basic research should be
   emphasized as the foundation for interdisciplinary research and teaching. We should have clear priorities that also reflect any reorganization needs.

   Winter at campus Dragvoll, NTNU OBJECTIVES:
     * The Faculty of Humanities should strengthen the quality of its research by prioritizing strong research and high-quality artistic endeavours.
     * The establishment of national and international research networks will be given priority.
     * Strong academic disciplines will be encouraged to become outstanding.
     * The faculty's academic disciplines should participate in interdisciplinary research with humanistic perspectives, and show how humanistic knowledge is needed to meet the challenges of our
       times.

Education and learning

   The education offered by the Faculty of Humanities will be research-based and high quality, both in discipline-based and interdisciplinary studies. The faculty will adapt its portfolio of study
   programmes over the next few years by concentrating them, giving priority to courses that are attractive and of high quality.

   Faculty of Humanities

Strategy for the Faculty of Humanities, 2012 - 2020

Vision

   The Faculty of Humanities (HF) should be a humanistic force in a technical and scientific university as well as in society at large and the realm of the arts and culture. HF will offer studies
   and conduct research in the core areas of the field. The faculty will also play an active role in the development of interdisciplinarity. Practical, aesthetic and artistic activities should be
   a central part of the faculty profile. The faculty's academic activities must also be of a quality that is recognized in its international academic peer relationships.

Values

   Summer at Dragvoll campus The Faculty of Humanities takes as its basic operating values the ideas of "creative, critical and constructive". The faculty will further the values of the European
   university tradition and promote knowledge, critical reflection, tolerance and fairness. All academic activities will be characterized by openness, curiosity and respect for other disciplines
   and traditions. The faculty will educate individuals to provide them insight and understanding, and the ability to undertake ethical reflection, to equip them with the ability to assume their
   local and global social responsibilities.

The Faculty of Humanities' social mission

   The academic activities of the faculty are based on strong academic disciplines. With this as its foundation, the faculty will execute its social mission by contributing to the development of
   democratic attitudes and understanding. We will prioritize outstanding professional work, interdisciplinarity and social relevance.
   Our multi-disciplinary environment in climate and energy research should be expanded to 2020, along with the disciplines of music technology, cultural heritage management and applied ethics.
   Our faculty has been central in the creation of these areas, and will continue to initiate the establishment of new ones. The five-year integrated teacher education programme is being fostered
   now and will be given priority in the future. We should also prepare for areas that have the potential for excellence beyond what we know today.

Research and artistic activities

   The faculty should contribute to the continuing development of national and international knowledge through international-level research and artistic activities. Basic research should be
   emphasized as the foundation for interdisciplinary research and teaching. We should have clear priorities that also reflect any reorganization needs.

Interdisciplinary research areas at the Faculty of Humanities

   The Faculty of Humanities has established three interdisciplinary research areas, to encourage research collaboration across the various departments and academic areas at the faculty.

   The interdisciplinary research areas for the period of 01.08.2009-31.07.2012 are:
     * Performativity: Art, communication and the formation of knowledge in the present time
     * European integration: Memory, power and identity
     * Language Technology, Language Development, Theoretical Linguistics (SSTL)

   The research areas will contribute to the improvement of academic quality, encourage larger research projects, and help strengthen the profile of the faculty, departments and academic areas.

   Our specific objectives are:

   - Increased scientific publication through valid journals and publishers
   - Developing research projects with the intention to apply for external funding, both at home and abroad
   - Strengthening the academic quality of PhD applications, in order to contribute to increased competition for available positions, particularly within areas where an increase in the number of
   PhD candidates is crucial
   - The integration of PhD candidates and postdoctoral fellows into an active research environment, which would contribute to completion of projects and improve the time and degree of completion
   - Increased internationalization of research within the interdisciplinary research area

   Work within the three areas will commence in the fall of 2009. Watch this space for more information on program declarations, management, organization and activities.

Language Technology, Language Development, Theoretical Linguistics (SSTL)

   Theoretical Linguistics, including General Phonetics, has been a sustained field of education and research at NTNU for nearly 40 years. While in the beginning located only in the Department of
   Language and Communication Studies (ISK), the discipline of Theoretical Linguistics is now a very active and internationally oriented field also in the Department of Scandinavian Studies and
   Comparative Literature (INL) and the Department of Modern Foreign Languages (IFS).

Program declaration SSTL

   Theoretical Linguistics, including General Phonetics, has been a sustained field of education and research at NTNU for nearly 40 years. While in the beginning located only in the Department of
   Language and Communication Studies (ISK), the discipline of Theoretical Linguistics is now a very active and internationally oriented field also in the Department of Scandinavian Studies and
   Comparative Literature (INL) and the Department of Modern Foreign Languages (IFS).

   In General Phonetics, the phonetics group at ISK has a unique position being the only place in Norway that has phonetic research and teaching as its prime institutional responsibility, and the
   ISK phoneticians contribute to theoretical and applied research (e.g. speech synthesis and speech recognition), with a wide circle of cooperation partners locally (both in their own Faculty and
   at Gløshaugen) as well as internationally. In Theoretical Linguistics proper, the level of activity is reflected both in a richness of theoretical approaches (including LFG, HPSG, GB,
   Minimalism), which is exceptional on a world basis, and in research networks, spanning not only networks devoted to the study of Scandinavian languages and their dialects, but also, in Europe
   the other Germanic languages (English and German) and the Balkan and South Slavic area, and in Asia especially East and South Asian languages (Mandarin Chinese, the languages of India), and in
   Africa all of the three main linguistic areas Bantu, Ethio-Semitic and West-African. Furthermore, the linguistic effects of globalization, as witnessed in accelerating phenomena of language
   contact and language change in many parts of the globe, have become thriving fields of research in all three departments, especially as it relates to first, second, and third language
   acquisition, but research on linguistic identity and on minority and majority languages is also in vogue. Experimental methods are widely used, for instance in the Phonetics Lab at ISK and in
   the Language Acquisition and Language Processing Lab at IFS.

   As linguistic theory and formalism consolidated throughout the 70s and 80s, giving rise to the development of computational tools and applications, linguists at ISK performed a development of
   computational lexical resources during the late 80s and 90s which is still outstanding internationally, and from early 2000 these resources have become supplemented by state of the art
   grammatical and semantic analysis tools. Digital documentation of language resources has correspondingly been a key activity, where the groups at NTNU, apart from the documentation of
   Norwegian, have also been involved in documentation of Old Slavic and of six African languages. In particular, one may mention the breaking of new empirical and theoretical ground in
   dialectology through the investigation and documentation of Norwegian and Scandinavian dialect syntax done at INL. This work is done in collaboration with several other universities in the
   Nordic countries, through the Nordic Center of Excellence of Microcomparative Syntax (NORMS), and through the ScanDiaSyn and NorDiaSyn networks/projects.

   Theoretically sustained research on language acquisition and language development are thriving new fields in all three departments. At ISK, this research is primarily done in the phonetics
   group and in applied linguistics. IFS and INL collaborate on various subprojects centering on the comparative and acquisitional study of Mandarin Chinese, English, and Norwegian. Also, in the
   Language Acquisition and Language Processing Lab at IFS language skills in children and adults are investigated. Experimental research on language acquisition (first language acquisition with
   children and second language acquisition with adults) as well as on language processing (for instance comprehension and categorisation) is done with the aim of finding out how humans develop
   their abilities to understand and reflect on the world around them and to talk about it.

   A common denominator of the theoretical approaches both in linguistics and phonetics and the computational developments is the idea of genericity: In theoretical linguistic research, a key
   assumption is that human languages are largely based on a common design. This assumption is fundamental for the comparative theoretical and empirical research being done at INL and IFS, seeking
   to develop e.g. Scandinavian and English linguistics as research disciplines beyond their traditional limits of descriptive one-language focus. In language technology, the corresponding
   assumption is bi-pronged: (1) when building computational applications involving language, the linguistic systems should be the same whether the application is ma¬chine translation, text
   summary, grammar checking, robot navigation, etc.; (2) reflecting the theoretical genericity assumption, in language technology, multilingual shared design and reusability of resources are key
   desiderata. Through the combined ongoing efforts of the theoretical, acquisitional and computational groups, the groups are constructing genericity-based designs and products that aim beyond
   the current state of the art, with a basis in soundly used existing analytic and computational practice.

Program declaration SSTL

   Theoretical Linguistics, including General Phonetics, has been a sustained field of education and research at NTNU for nearly 40 years. While in the beginning located only in the Department of
   Language and Communication Studies (ISK), the discipline of Theoretical Linguistics is now a very active and internationally oriented field also in the Department of Scandinavian Studies and
   Comparative Literature (INL) and the Department of Modern Foreign Languages (IFS).

   In General Phonetics, the phonetics group at ISK has a unique position being the only place in Norway that has phonetic research and teaching as its prime institutional responsibility, and the
   ISK phoneticians contribute to theoretical and applied research (e.g. speech synthesis and speech recognition), with a wide circle of cooperation partners locally (both in their own Faculty and
   at Gløshaugen) as well as internationally. In Theoretical Linguistics proper, the level of activity is reflected both in a richness of theoretical approaches (including LFG, HPSG, GB,
   Minimalism), which is exceptional on a world basis, and in research networks, spanning not only networks devoted to the study of Scandinavian languages and their dialects, but also, in Europe
   the other Germanic languages (English and German) and the Balkan and South Slavic area, and in Asia especially East and South Asian languages (Mandarin Chinese, the languages of India), and in
   Africa all of the three main linguistic areas Bantu, Ethio-Semitic and West-African. Furthermore, the linguistic effects of globalization, as witnessed in accelerating phenomena of language
   contact and language change in many parts of the globe, have become thriving fields of research in all three departments, especially as it relates to first, second, and third language
   acquisition, but research on linguistic identity and on minority and majority languages is also in vogue. Experimental methods are widely used, for instance in the Phonetics Lab at ISK and in
   the Language Acquisition and Language Processing Lab at IFS.

   As linguistic theory and formalism consolidated throughout the 70s and 80s, giving rise to the development of computational tools and applications, linguists at ISK performed a development of
   computational lexical resources during the late 80s and 90s which is still outstanding internationally, and from early 2000 these resources have become supplemented by state of the art
   grammatical and semantic analysis tools. Digital documentation of language resources has correspondingly been a key activity, where the groups at NTNU, apart from the documentation of
   Norwegian, have also been involved in documentation of Old Slavic and of six African languages. In particular, one may mention the breaking of new empirical and theoretical ground in
   dialectology through the investigation and documentation of Norwegian and Scandinavian dialect syntax done at INL. This work is done in collaboration with several other universities in the
   Nordic countries, through the Nordic Center of Excellence of Microcomparative Syntax (NORMS), and through the ScanDiaSyn and NorDiaSyn networks/projects.

   Theoretically sustained research on language acquisition and language development are thriving new fields in all three departments. At ISK, this research is primarily done in the phonetics
   group and in applied linguistics. IFS and INL collaborate on various subprojects centering on the comparative and acquisitional study of Mandarin Chinese, English, and Norwegian. Also, in the
   Language Acquisition and Language Processing Lab at IFS language skills in children and adults are investigated. Experimental research on language acquisition (first language acquisition with
   children and second language acquisition with adults) as well as on language processing (for instance comprehension and categorisation) is done with the aim of finding out how humans develop
   their abilities to understand and reflect on the world around them and to talk about it.

   A common denominator of the theoretical approaches both in linguistics and phonetics and the computational developments is the idea of genericity: In theoretical linguistic research, a key
   assumption is that human languages are largely based on a common design. This assumption is fundamental for the comparative theoretical and empirical research being done at INL and IFS, seeking
   to develop e.g. Scandinavian and English linguistics as research disciplines beyond their traditional limits of descriptive one-language focus. In language technology, the corresponding
   assumption is bi-pronged: (1) when building computational applications involving language, the linguistic systems should be the same whether the application is ma¬chine translation, text
   summary, grammar checking, robot navigation, etc.; (2) reflecting the theoretical genericity assumption, in language technology, multilingual shared design and reusability of resources are key
   desiderata. Through the combined ongoing efforts of the theoretical, acquisitional and computational groups, the groups are constructing genericity-based designs and products that aim beyond
   the current state of the art, with a basis in soundly used existing analytic and computational practice.

PerFormativity

- Art, Communication and Knowledge Formation

   Performativityis a new interdisciplinary focus area at the Faculty of Humanities created to research the role of performativity in contemporary art, communication and knowledge formation.
   Through this research we aim to expand and challenge our understanding of the performative - of active intervention - in these fields. This focus area promotes interdisciplinarity, which
   consists on the meeting of practical work and theoretical reflexion.

About the project

- Performativity in Art, Communication and Knowledge Formation

   Performativity is an interdisciplinary focus area at the Faculty of Humanities created to research the role of performativity in contemporary art, communication and knowledge formation. Through
   this research we aim to expand and challenge our understanding of the performative - of active intervention - in these fields. This focus area promotes interdisciplinarity, which consists on
   the meeting of practical work and theoretical reflexion.

   We find the performative as «high tech» artistic practices that challenge established understandings of technology as purely instrumental and which even enter the realm of science by framing
   their projects as experiments. There is a clear focus on intervention and creativity within 'performance' and various forms of virtuality and games. Performativity as concept and as perspective
   challenges today established visions of knowledge formation and established understandings of the relationship between theory and practice, between scene and venue, between art and science.

   Performativity may denote specific traits of various forms of expression, but also deal with a particular perspective in all communication. In the former case performativity deals with, for
   instance, words that create what they name. Furthermore it deals with stagings, rituals and musical expression where what is created in the moment is prioritized over reenactment and
   representation. Understood as a more general perspective, performativity deals with bringing out the creative, constitutive and active in every concept and every expression. In this way
   performativity as perspective also deals with understanding staging as a basic condition for what it is to continuously be constituted as a subject.

   The creation of this focus area is an attempt from the Faculty of Humanities to 'make use of the potential for collaborative research across the boundaries of institutes and disciplines at the
   Faculty of Humanities to develop disciplinary quality, stimulate larger research projects and contribute to create a profile of the faculty, institutes and disciplinary environment'. The
   Faculty's concrete objectives are, among others, increasing academic publishing in relevant networks and the formation of research projects for applying to external research funding
   institutions on national and international levels. The priority of the performativity research area is to stimulate projects with new methodologies that address the intersection between
   theoretical and practical knowledge interests.

About the project

- Performativity in Art, Communication and Knowledge Formation

   Performativity is an interdisciplinary focus area at the Faculty of Humanities created to research the role of performativity in contemporary art, communication and knowledge formation. Through
   this research we aim to expand and challenge our understanding of the performative - of active intervention - in these fields. This focus area promotes interdisciplinarity, which consists on
   the meeting of practical work and theoretical reflexion.

   We find the performative as «high tech» artistic practices that challenge established understandings of technology as purely instrumental and which even enter the realm of science by framing
   their projects as experiments. There is a clear focus on intervention and creativity within 'performance' and various forms of virtuality and games. Performativity as concept and as perspective
   challenges today established visions of knowledge formation and established understandings of the relationship between theory and practice, between scene and venue, between art and science.

   Performativity may denote specific traits of various forms of expression, but also deal with a particular perspective in all communication. In the former case performativity deals with, for
   instance, words that create what they name. Furthermore it deals with stagings, rituals and musical expression where what is created in the moment is prioritized over reenactment and
   representation. Understood as a more general perspective, performativity deals with bringing out the creative, constitutive and active in every concept and every expression. In this way
   performativity as perspective also deals with understanding staging as a basic condition for what it is to continuously be constituted as a subject.

   The creation of this focus area is an attempt from the Faculty of Humanities to 'make use of the potential for collaborative research across the boundaries of institutes and disciplines at the
   Faculty of Humanities to develop disciplinary quality, stimulate larger research projects and contribute to create a profile of the faculty, institutes and disciplinary environment'. The
   Faculty's concrete objectives are, among others, increasing academic publishing in relevant networks and the formation of research projects for applying to external research funding
   institutions on national and international levels. The priority of the performativity research area is to stimulate projects with new methodologies that address the intersection between
   theoretical and practical knowledge interests.

The Towerblock post-mortem

- artbased research

   The Tower Block is the main building in the old central hospital in Trondheim. Now it is demolished as a new modern hospital is rising on its grounds. As a way of drawing attention to the
   disappearance of an emotional landmark in the city, we have created a project that explores the connection of the Tower block and the city of Trondheim, focusing on the memories that the site
   has generated in the people over time.

   The project is divided into three distinct stages:
     * First we have created a webpage that allows people gathering memories from the Tower block. At the web page www.hoyblokka.no the memories are presented as light in the windows of the Tower
       block. Some memories are written, some are told, and some are presented in various experimental ways, using the concepts of soundscapes, landscapes and handscapes.
     * These memories are the basis for the second stage, a memorial service for the Tower block held in january 2011. In the ruins of the Tower blokc, under its concrete skeleton a performance in
       the form of a multimedia ritual where light, sound and video projection called the Tower block to life for the last time.
     * Third, the Tower Block is a research project that explores the relations between art and research. We focus on topics such as the performative aspects of memories; the role of writing and
       technology in the manifestation of memory; the nature of place and emptiness in wakening the presence of things long gone; the relationship between emptyness and technology; and what can we
       learn about performance from a project where the performance is the actual burying of a hospital building?

Picturing the Brain

- Perspectives on Neuroimaging

   Neuroimaging enjoys an increasing prominence, not only among medical doctors, neuroscientists and philosophers, but in society at large. Brain images are deeply compelling, and are claimed to
   provide windows into the living brain. Yet what these images really show remains a debated issue. The research project Picturing the Brain: Perspectives on Neuroimaging (2010-2013) seeks to
   deepen our understanding of the epistemological roles neuroimaging technologies play in the conduct and communication of medicine and science. The primary objective is, more precisely, to
   develop a fine-grained understanding of socio-cultural and ethical issues that arise in relation to current applications of these technologies, as they are put to use as cognitive tools, as
   perceptual prostheses, and as visual rhetoric. The project is interdisciplinary and allows researchers with backgrounds in media studies, philosophy, digital media engineering, medical imaging,
   neuroscience, and creative arts to work together on specific tasks in varying configurations. The project is funded by the Research Council of Norway.

ArTe

   The ArTe research project  aims at enhancing the state of knowledge at the interdisciplinary intersection of software and the arts. The research questions explore the interplay between artwork,
   technology, artist, and audience. Sub-goals are:

   G1. Develop knowledge on the interdisciplinary nature of software production in which the software process interact with artistic process (i.e. the creation of heavily software-dependent
   artworks).

   G2. Support artists who utilize software for the creation of their artwork with software technology.

   We focus on technology such as Arduino, Processing, and Scratch, which enable broad audience to become makers of digital artistic expressions. ArTe researchers exploit well defined research
   methods, supported by qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis techniques, to design and execute valid research studies.

   The research is carried out at the Department of Computer and Information Science (IDI) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway. IDI has an established
   PhD program with 100 active PhD students.

Chain Reaction

- By Elena Perez

   Chain Reaction is a hybrid form of pervasive game and interactive theater that investigates the challenges of combining ubiquitous computing and game design with theatre conventions. Perez uses
   game design as part of her research process in order to explore how participatory games can be used to enable alternative ways of engaging with theatre, more specifically how games together
   with new media applications can foster creative participation in artistic practices.

   Chain Reaction experiments with howto make participants engage artistically with others in public spaces, and ultimately create a short piece of theatre as a result of their interaction with
   the city. It was developed from August to October 2009 in the city of Berkeley, California, and orchestrated for the second time in Theaterhouse Avantgarden in Trondheim, Norway, in May 2011.


   Chain Reaction´s model is the following: Players meet in an specific place in the open, a park or a plaza, or inside a venue theatre house, where a narrative is delivered by actors who then
   explain the game rules and hand in maps and cellphones. In the map there are checkpoints marked. Players must go in groups of two and visit all the checkpoints. In each checkpoint there is an
   actor that delivers a task that players must complete. The tasks are about generating different pieces of artistic material - text, sound, movement and a theatre sculpture - resulting from the
   interaction with the environment. In the last checkpoint, teams re-group and the task is about devising a short piece of performance out of the materials they have collected. Every group
   performs its piece to the rest of participants -other players and the actors - and there is a vote to decide on the best show, who wins a symbolic trophy. Movement task: Participants were asked
   to perform a slow motion movement sequence while listening to music, at Trondheim torg, 2011. (Photo: Ingvild Aarseth)

   (Song mission: Participants were asked to engage in conversation with a stranger and get her to sing her favorite song. This team in Berkeley succeeded after trying for 20 minutes)

Chain Reaction

- By Elena Perez

   Chain Reaction is a hybrid form of pervasive game and interactive theater that investigates the challenges of combining ubiquitous computing and game design with theatre conventions. Perez uses
   game design as part of her research process in order to explore how participatory games can be used to enable alternative ways of engaging with theatre, more specifically how games together
   with new media applications can foster creative participation in artistic practices.

   Chain Reaction experiments with howto make participants engage artistically with others in public spaces, and ultimately create a short piece of theatre as a result of their interaction with
   the city. It was developed from August to October 2009 in the city of Berkeley, California, and orchestrated for the second time in Theaterhouse Avantgarden in Trondheim, Norway, in May 2011.


   Chain Reaction´s model is the following: Players meet in an specific place in the open, a park or a plaza, or inside a venue theatre house, where a narrative is delivered by actors who then
   explain the game rules and hand in maps and cellphones. In the map there are checkpoints marked. Players must go in groups of two and visit all the checkpoints. In each checkpoint there is an
   actor that delivers a task that players must complete. The tasks are about generating different pieces of artistic material - text, sound, movement and a theatre sculpture - resulting from the
   interaction with the environment. In the last checkpoint, teams re-group and the task is about devising a short piece of performance out of the materials they have collected. Every group
   performs its piece to the rest of participants -other players and the actors - and there is a vote to decide on the best show, who wins a symbolic trophy. Movement task: Participants were asked
   to perform a slow motion movement sequence while listening to music, at Trondheim torg, 2011. (Photo: Ingvild Aarseth)

   (Song mission: Participants were asked to engage in conversation with a stranger and get her to sing her favorite song. This team in Berkeley succeeded after trying for 20 minutes)

   in society, industry, and public-sector activities.

Our specific mission

   Our main profile in science and technology gives us a particular responsibility to develop the technological foundation for the society of the future. Programmes of professional study at
   master's degree level are a strong point at NTNU.
   We will also work at the interface of technology, natural science, medicine, architecture, the humanities and social science. NTNU has a responsibility to offer university education in art and
   to undertake artistic development work.
   We will use our academic breadth and interdisciplinary expertise to solve complex problems and increase understanding of the relationships between technology, society and environment. We will

   development in developing countries. We will engage in solving global challenges in health and welfare, energy and climate, the environment and use of resources. Our activities will promote
   human rights and intercultural dialogue.

Overarching goals and choices of direction

Internationally outstanding

   NTNU aims to become an outstanding university by international standards. This requires us to have world-class academic environments ourselves, and to seek collaboration with other leading
   knowledge communities in the world. In areas that are key to our mission in society, NTNU will take responsibility for building outstanding environments. We must set priorities for our
   resources so that we can provide development opportunities for the best teachers, researchers and academic groups, regardless of area.
   Our academic environments must concentrate their activities in order to create robust groups with quality at an international level. They must create adequate scope for the long-term basic
   research and take advantage of the opportunities that interdisciplinary collaboration provides to create unique results within their own subject. The academic environments must continue their
   close collaboration with the private and public sectors to develop the expertise that society needs.
   Motivated employees and students are a prerequisite to enable NTNU to achieve its objectives. Each individual has an independent responsibility to contribute to a fertile and favourable
   environment for work and learning, and to NTNU's efforts to fulfil its mission in society

Objectives

     * The entire organization upholds quality at a high international level and several academic environments are in the top international league, measured by international peer review.
     * NTNU has first-class laboratories and infrastructure for research and education.
     * Our main profile and unique attributes provide an advantage in academic competition at the national and international level, and in collaboration with private- and public-sector
       organizations.
     * We attract the best students and staff, and are internationally renowned for the quality of our student life.
     * Students and staff members feel that they belong to NTNU and are proud of their affiliation.

The way forward

     * We will give priority to long-term basic research and enabling technologies, and create a sound infrastructure for these.<
     * We will give priority to research-based education for the working life of the future, and be a driving force in sustainable innovation.

     * We will give priority to the work and learning environment at the university, and we will build on Trondheim's position as a leading student city.

Research and artistic activities

   The development of society depends on cultural renewal and research-based knowledge. An objective of research is to provide insight into technology, society and culture. Research must help to
   solve relevant problems and empower us to face the challenges of the future. Complex problems can be solved only with in-depth disciplinary knowledge and interdisciplinary collaboration. There
   must be a balance and interaction between applied and long-term basic research.
   NTNU's research and artistic activities are part of the international academic community, and all our academic environments have a responsibility to contribute actively to the development of
   subject areas and disciplines. As a knowledge nation, Norway must keep pace with international research, and as a large university we must aspire to leave a lasting impression.
   Internationalization is a prerequisite for development of high quality. Visibility at the national and international level makes us attractive for collaboration with the best players. This
   requires robust academic environments with a distinct profile, clear priorities, and disciplinary concentration. The environments must identify tomorrow's outstanding researchers and artists,
   and motivate students to pursue research. The doctoral programmes are a key instrument for renewing research and strengthening society's knowledge base.

Objectives

     * All research and artistic activities uphold a high international level, and several scientific and artistic environments are in the top international league.
     * The research environments have a distinct profile that supports education and innovation, and that takes advantage of interdisciplinary links.
     * The research is long-term and fundamental. It contributes to international development of knowledge and creates the basis for future innovation.
     * NTNU's doctoral programmes are in demand and maintain a high international standard

The way forward

     * We will give priority to internationalization and develop expertise in initiating, participating in and leading international research projects.
     * We will identify and develop talents in research and art, and establish mechanisms to maintain and develop academic environments in the top international league.
     * We will concentrate our research through robust academic environments of high quality and with a clear academic profile.
     * We will strengthen the fundamental, long-term research and enabling technologies such as ICT, biotechnology and nanotechnology.
     * We will work to ensure that the public and private sectors seek and value doctoral graduates.

Education and learning environment

   There is a growing need for people with expertise who can tackle complex challenges in society. Competition for students is intensifying in the global education market; flexibility and ability
   to change are important. If we are to attract the most talented students and teaching staff, NTNU must take advantage of its unique attributes and develop a clear, ambitious profile for our
   academic portfolio. Studies must take place in a rich and inclusive learning environment. They must build on sound research and stimulate critical reflection and innovation.
   Alliances with strong academic environments at the national and international level create attractive programmes of study, increase the quality of the education and strengthen student mobility.
   Close dialogue with private- and public-sector organizations is needed to develop programmes of study that are relevant to society and to prepare students for the labour market they face both
   during and after their studies. The requirements for skills are changing continuously. This requires adapted learning activities and lifelong learning.
   Students must take responsibility for their own learning and be involved in the development of education programmes, teaching, and the learning environment. NTNU must provide students with
   close follow-up and evaluations that enhance learning. Leaders of education, teaching, and the learning environment must have clear roles and clear responsibility. The culture of quality
   improvement in the academic environments must be developed further, and the quality of education must be followed up continuously.

Objectives

     * NTNU's graduates have relevant and recognized expertise. They are in demand nationally and internationally.t
     * All the programmes of study are characterized by academic and teaching quality at a high international level.
     * The teaching stimulates students' critical reflection, and promotes interest in research and innovation.
     * NTNU has motivated students who are recruited nationally and internationally, and who can work across disciplinary boundaries and learning cultures.

The way forward

     * The studies will provide clear and documented qualifications for national and international working life.
     * The academic environments will concentrate the portfolio of studies to strengthen quality and give higher priority to international collaboration.
     * We will offer teaching that has close links to research and innovation and that stimulates interdisciplinarity.
     * We will increase students' involvement in improvement of education quality and create a varied and favourable learning environment.
     * All academic environments will develop first-class educational management and a culture of quality improvement using systematic evaluation and effective follow-up.
     * We will increase the scope and quality of continuing and further education.

Innovation and creativity

   NTNU has helped to build the Norway of today. Our ambition is to be an even more important contributor to sustainable value creation in the future. We must stimulate increased innovation
   throughout the breadth of NTNU's subject areas. This is to be clearly reflected in the education that we offer. Our interdisciplinary profile and experience in collaboration with society and
   business provide NTNU with a competitive advantage in innovation.
   Our innovation activities arise from education, research and artistic work. The entire process from ideas to new products and services must function optimally, and capacity for the education of
   entrepreneurs must increase. In cooperation with other players, NTNU must establish the basis for more spin-off companies and development in existing enterprises.
   Effective innovation requires closer, stronger and more professionalized collaboration with the private and public sectors. A broad base of research forms the foundation for ideas that are
   useful to society and have potential for commercialization. We must strengthen interdisciplinary research on innovation processes, and encourage innovation among students and staff.

Objectives

     * NTNU is a driving force for adaptation and sustainable innovation in society.
     * NTNU is internationally outstanding within research-based innovation and collaboration with the private and public sectors.
     * Students and staff throughout NTNU's academic breadth participate in entrepreneurship and innovation.
     * NTNU has a well-functioning internal system for innovation, from ideas to spin-off companies.

The way forward

     * We will professionalize and develop external relationships internationally, nationally and regionally.
     * We will increase our research commitment to processes related to innovation and entrepreneurship.
     * Innovation activities at NTNU will emphasize interdisciplinarity and collaboration with business and society.
     * We will offer infrastructure and professional support functions for staff, students and spin-off companies.

Outreach and communication

   Universities must contribute to a knowledge-based public debate, convey insights, and provide the public with an understanding of the relevance of research.
   NTNU wishes to stimulate sound development of society through dissemination of knowledge and expertise. Our dissemination and communication will encompass knowledge, collections, art and
   culture. We take a specific responsibility for science and technology. Dissemination must reflect the constantly changing landscape of knowledge.
   Dissemination of research outputs to the public must take place in an open dialogue with society. Feedback from the outside world must have an impact on both research and education, thus
   increasing the relevance of our activities. The dissemination of research competes for attention in the information society. NTNU must develop and apply innovative approaches and media.
   Effective dissemination and communication strengthen the institution's reputation. This can help to recruit talented staff and students, and make us an attractive partner for business and
   knowledge institutions.

Objectives

     * Dissemination of knowledge is an integral part of NTNU's activities, and our students and staff are active contributors to public debate.
     * NTNU assists decision-makers nationally and internationally by providing research-based expertise.
     * We achieve effective dissemination of our results in research, education and innovation, and generate interest in science and technology.
     * NTNU is visible and has a strong national and international reputation.

The way forward

     * We will establish and participate in strategic forums for contact with society.
     * We will take a specific responsibility for increasing society's knowledge of science and technology.
     * We will promote our academic environments in the arts more strongly in our dissemination and communication.
     * We will secure scientific collections and make them more accessible.
     * We will strengthen international dissemination and communication.
     * We will increase our endeavours to create a uniting NTNU identity among students, staff, and alumni.

Leadership, participation and resources

   Organization and resources must support our core activities. Better services, readily available information and good support systems contribute to this. NTNU must be responsible for an
   environmentally responsible operation.
   The operating context changes rapidly, and this imposes stringent requirements for good leadership and for the organization's adaptability. Leaders must make demanding strategic choices to
   develop our activities and establish the basis for an open, accepting and safe working environment. They have a specific responsibility to strengthen work on health, safety and the environment
   (HSE) at their units.
   An internationally outstanding university depends on the active involvement of students and staff. This requires inclusive leadership and effective collaboration with the student democracy and
   the employees' organizations.
   One of NTNU's great challenges is to recruit highly talented and motivated people to scientific and technical-administrative positions. In priority areas, we must seek staff members with
   expertise from internationally leading academic environments, and have suitable mechanisms for this. NTNU has a particular challenge in recruiting more women to technology and science.

Objectives

     * NTNU has leaders with the ability to set goals, generate enthusiasm and promote academic development.
     * NTNU has an open, accepting and safe working environment with broad participation from students and staff.

     * We will pursue an active human resources policy that contributes to good work and learning environments, emphasizing recruitment, development of staff and equal opportunity.
     * We will strengthen the systematic health, safety and environment (HSE) work among students and staff.
     * We will take greater responsibility for the environment around us.
     * We will create greater scope for strategic priority setting at all levels.
     * We will undertake active property management in which we give priority to renewal of the buildings and the scientific infrastructure.
     * We will establish better services and develop support systems so that students and staff have more time for their primary responsibilities.

NTNU Campuses

   A village of buildings linked by glassed-over "streets", an art gallery, two working locomotives and a giant ocean basin for testing model ships are just a small sampling of what you'll find on
   NTNU's campuses.

What you'll find where:

   Gløshaugen -- the main science and technology campus
   Dragvoll -- the main humanities campus
   Lerkendal/Valgrinda -- a shared campus with SINTEF
   Tyholt -- home to the marine technology programme
   Kalvskinnet -- home to NTNU's Natural History museum
   Øya -- the hospital campus
   Olavskvartalet -- music at Olavshallen, arts and architecture across the river
   Other research stations -- Ringve botanical garden in Lade, and farther afield

   For fun,  watch a video of two extremely athletic NTNU students as they free run through the university's main campuses.

Gløshaugen

   Realfagbygget The Faculties of Engineering Science and Technology, Natural Sciences and Technology, and Information Technology, Mathematics and Electrical Engineering are all found here.
   Gløshaugen is also home to NTNU's first building, the Hovedbygningen, completed in 1910, and Realfagbygget, the natural sciences building, opened in 2000. Realfagbygget covers approximately
   60,000 square metres, and is the largest building in Trondheim.Seven cafes and cafeterias serve hot drinks and a variety of food throughout the day.

   Libraries abound  - Three of NTNU's 11 libraries are located at the Gløshaugen campus - the main Technology Library, the Architecture, Civil Engineering and Product Design Library, and the
   Natural Science Library. NTNUI, the university's student athletic association, has a sports centre at the Gløshaugen campus where you can work out or take classes if you're an association
   member.

   Find the unexpected - The campus is full of surprises, not the least of which are two functioning locomotives, the Ohma Electra, an electric locomotive that's parked next to the Old electrical
   engineering building, and the Bjørkelangen, a steam locomotive that's parked next to the Varmeteknisk, Thermal energy building. Although the days are long gone when being an engineer just
   applied to operating locomotives, it seems fitting to find these reminders of the past at NTNU's main engineering campus.

Dragvoll Dragvoll

   Dragvoll is the main campus for the Faculty of Humanities and the Faculty of Social Sciences and Technology Management, along with the Dragvoll Library, the main library for the arts, social
   sciences and humanities. The Dragvoll campus is divided into 12 buildings ("bygg") that are linked by "streets" that are glassed over, like a greenhouse, a design that resulted from an
   architecture contest in 1969. Three separate buildings, called pavilions, house the Centre for Rural Research and NTNU-Videre (Pavilion A), a private research company owned by NTNU called NTNU
   Samfunnsforsking AS (Pavilion B) and the Norwegian Centre for Child Research and the Department of Education (Pavilion C). The Dragvoll Sports Centre is located behind the pavilions, and
   contains two training halls, a gymnasium, a weight training hall, three squash courts, a climbing wall and a number of other facilities. SiT, the student services group, also has five
   cafeterias or kiosks where you can purchase food, along with a bookstore .

Lerkendal/Valgrinda

   The southern part of the Gløshaugen campus, down by the Rosenborg football club's stadium, is called Lerkendal/Valgrinda, and is home to a number of buildings occupied by SINTEF, Scandinavia's
   largest independent research institute, and a frequent partner in NTNU's research projects. Many SINTEF researchers also teach at NTNU, which is not surprising when you realize that the
   institute was a spin-off from NTNU's predecessor, NTH, in 1950. This campus is also home to the departments of Petroleum Engineering and Applied Geophysics, Production and Quality Engineering,
   and Hydraulic and Environmental Engineering, as well as the Valgrinda Library and NTNU Technology Transfer.

Tyholt

   Tyholt may be the most visible of NTNU's campuses, simply because of the colourful 120-metre high telecommunications tower that can be seen from throughout the city. NTNU's buildings at Tyholt
   may be somewhat less colourful than the tower, but they are every bit as impressive, for it's here that you'll find the Department of Marine Technology, right next to the Ship Model Tank,
   Cavitation Tunnel and the Ocean Basin Laboratory. The ocean research facilities are technically owned by MARINTEK, a branch of SINTEF, but are used widely in NTNU research. The Marine
   Technology Library, which is also shared between NTNU and MARINTEK, is also located here, as is a SiT cafeteria.

Illustrasjonsbilde/FOTO Kalvskinnet and downtown

   Kalvskinnet, on the southern fringe of Trondheim's downtown, is home to the university's Museum of Natural History and Archaeology, as well as the Gunnerus Library, Norway's oldest scientific
   library. The library focuses on archaeology, botany, and zoology, but contains other natural science-related books. SiT has a Tapir bookstore and a cafeteria here as well.

   Down on the waterfront you'll find NTNU's own Sealab, or more formally, the NTNU Centre of Fisheries and Aquaculture, a shared research facility right in downtown Trondheim. Four of NTNU's
   seven faculties have research programmes here. SINTEF's Institutes of Fisheries and Aquaculture, Materials and Chemistry and Marine Environmental Technology also have representatives here too.

Øya

   Øya, a little peninsula just outside of downtown Trondheim created by the wanderings of the Nidelva River, is where you'll find St Olavs Hospital, the main tertiary care hospital in mid-Norway.
   Not surprisingly, NTNU's Department of Medicine is located here, with a host of research facilities, including the Kavli Centre for Systems Neuroscience/Centre for the Biology of Memory . SiT
   operates three cafeterias throughout the campus.

Olavskvartalet, Møllenberg and Brattøra

   Olavskvartalet features Trondheim's own concert hall, Olavshallen, where the Trondheim Symphony Orchestra regularly performs, and where NTNU's Department of Music has its music performance
   studies and music technology programmes. The Trondheim Academy of Fine Art is located across the Nidelva River from Olavshallen, in a fine building that also houses the academy's gallery.

Farther afield - other research facilities

   NTNU also has a number of far-flung research facilities, including the Ringve Botanical Garden, next to the Ringve Music Museum in Lade, the Department of Biology's Trondheim Biological
   Station, right on Trondheim fjord to the west of the city itself, and the Kongsvoll Biological Station, nearly three hours by car to the south, on the fringe of Dovrefjell National Park. Across
   from the biological station you'll find

The Norwegian Social Welfare System

   What is covered by the Norwegian system?
   The Norwegian social welfare system includes health care, disability payments, pensions and survivors benefits. It is administered by NAV, the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration. NTNU
   employees are also covered by the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund.

   Health care coverage and finding a doctor
   You become a member of the Norwegian National Health Scheme when you receive your national ID number. A few weeks after you receive your ID number you should receive a mailing from NAV in which
   you are assigned a general practitioner (called fastlege in Norwegian). Health insurance coverage for non-Norwegian students is a little different and depends on what country the student is
   from. NTNU students, regardless of nationality, have access to a clinic at Gløshaugen. There is also easy access to student mental health counselling, located in the Moholt studentby.

   Dentists
   Norway's health system does not cover dental visits for adults, but children up to and including age 19 are cared for for free by the Sør-Trondelag County public dental clinics .There are 11
   clinics in the greater Trondheim area, with another two dozen throughout the county. Adults can also be treated at these public clinics, or at a private practititioner's office (in Norwegian).
   There is also a dentist on call on weekends and holidays who can be reached by calling 73 50 55 00, but be aware that if you are an adult, this service costs 75% more than a normal dentist's
   visit.

   Pharmacies/Chemists
   The greater Trondheim area is served by a number of chemists, or pharmacies (called apotek in Norwegian), most of which are typically open from 0900-1800 on weekdays and from 0900 to 1500 on
   Saturdays.

   There are a number of pharmacies near the hospital, and the hospital itself maintains a branch pharmacy that is open until midnight every day of the week at Solsiden, at Beddingen 4 (map), in
   downtown Trondheim.

   Doctors can write two types of prescriptions; one, on blue paper, is a medication that you must have to treat a health problem. These types of prescriptions are covered by the health insurance
   scheme, and so you as the patient pay only a nominal cost for the drug. Prescriptions written on white paper, for medicine that is not medically necessary, can also be filled at the pharmacy,
   but the patient bears the full cost of the drug. Full-time NTNU students are eligible for a refund for a portion of their medical and dental costs.

Visas and work/residence permits

   Apply for a visa via Application Portal Norway if you can.
   The Directorate for Immigration (UDI) is moving to an online application process, although it will still be necessary to bring supporting documents to a consulate or embassy. You can find the
   Application Portal online along with an interactive web page that enables you to determine if your circumstances will allow you to make your preliminary application on line.

   You can also check out the Trondheim Immigration Office's Facebook page.

   But... do you need a visa?
   All international students, visiting researchers and newly hired employees who are going to stay in Norway for more than 3 months must have a valid residence/work permit. The requirements may
   be slightly different for students depending upon your home country, your location when you apply for a permit and your source of funding. You can find a detailed description of the
   requirements for students on the UDI web page.

   If you are a resident of the EU/EFTA/EEA you have the right to live and work in Norway for up to three months, but you must register yourself with the police.

   Applications for most permits can be done via the Application Portal Norway, as above, but you will need to submit supporting documents to the appropriate embassy.

   Note that if you plan to bring your family with you to Norway, you will all need to go together at some point to show officials your family -- the Immigration officials will want to physically
   see your children.

   Renewing your residence/work permit
   It is possible to renew your permit with an application via Application Portal Norway.  Renewals should be submitted at least one month before the current permit expires, or even earlier if you
   need your passport for travel.

   You can visit the UDI website to read more about applying for and renewing your work permit from Norway.

   Processing times can be long
   Once submitted, processing times for work permits can vary anywhere from 1-4 months. A letter confirming you have been granted a work/residence permit will be sent in the mail.

   Application forms and what you need to apply
   The application forms for Non EU/ EEA countries are different than those for applicants from EU/EEA countries, and are different for individuals who are coming with a family or alone. While we
   have tried to summarize what you need below, there are so many small details that the best idea is to go directly to the UDI website for visa applications.

   In general, you will need to have:
   *Job offer (with Salary) / Letter of admission from the Office of International Relations
   * Passport (Must be valid for the duration of your stay in Norway)
   * Passport size photo
   * Letter from Consulate that issued your visa (in English)
   * Payment (see fees below).

   Fees
   Fees vary depending on which country you come from.The UDI website has a complete listing of different visa/permit fees. Note that it is not always possible to use foreign credit cards for
   payment at the UDI so be prepared to use cash.

   Insurance and health check requirements vary
   EU/EEA Students must also bring a proof of health insurance that is valid for the entire length of study in Norway. This can be proof of private insurance, an E-form, or the European Health
   Insurance Card.

   Students from specific countries may also have to have a tuberculosis examination. You can request more information about the health check at the Immigration Department.

   Where to go, appointments
   The Immigration Office is co-located with the Trondheim Police Station and is found at Gryta 4, 7010 Trondheim (just east of the railway station. Remember to check their Facebook page to see if
   there are changes in opening times or other useful information. You must have an appointment, which you get in one of three ways:
     * If you apply online for the visas and permits you need at the Application Portal Norway you will then be given a time to come to the Trondheim Police Station to present documents or pick
       them up, depending on where you are in the permitting process.
     * If you do not have access to the Internet, you can stop by the Immigration Office, Counter D, between 9:00 and 11:00 Mondays through Thursdays to get an appointment.
     * Information and appointment times are also available by telephone at 73 89 94 40, but this number is only staffed on Mondays through Thursdays from 0900-1130, and the number is often busy.

Norwegian Taxes

   Paying taxes in Norway requires that you have both a national identity number (fødselsnummer) and a tax card (skattekord). If you will only be in Norway for a short period, you may be issued a
   temporary D number. As a foreigner, you may also be entitled to a 10% tax reduction for your first 2 years in Norway.

   Here's what you need to know.

   ID number (fødselsnummer) and registration with the national population register
   Both the national ID number and the temporary D number are 11 digits; the national ID number starts with your birthdate and ends in 5 randomly generated digits. You'll need this number to get
   paid, to open a bank account and to pay taxes. Skattetatten, the Norwegian Tax Authority, has an online explanation of tax requirements in English that should be enough to get you started.

   You can apply for either a D-number or a national identity number at the Trondheim tax office, although you actually will file for this number from the National Register, which is co-located
   with the Tax Office. You must plan for it to take some time to get an ID number. Depending upon the time of year and the national registry's workload, you may have to wait several weeks or
   months. You have to fill out the form called "Notification to the National Registry of move to Norway from abroad." Bring your passport with residence/work permit stamp. You don't need to do
   this if you are from the other Nordic countries. Newcomers should make certain they have enough cash to cover expenses until they obtain one of these all-important numbers.

   Tax card
   Once you have been issued an ID number, you must return to the Tax Office and apply for a tax card. It is possible to get a tax card before getting an ID number. To do so, take your job
   contract and passport to the tax office. An informational brochure is available there.
   The tax card is used as a basis for withholding tax from salaries paid to employees working in Norway. Make sure that your employer has received your tax card before you get your first salary
   -- otherwise a 50% tax will automatically be withheld from your salary. If you have paid too much tax, you will get it back in your annual tax refund. Have your job contract and documentation
   of your expected salary with you when you go to the tax office.

   Personal tax return (Selvangivelse)
   A personal tax return will be sent to your registered address in the spring of the year following the income year. The tax return is to be completed and submitted to the tax authorities by
   April 30 in the year following the income year. You will receive an End of the Year Certificate (Årsoppgave) from your employer with some basic information on the salary and allowances you have
   earned in Norway. Please include this information in your tax return.

   Final tax assessment/settlement (Skatteoppgjøret)
   The final tax assessment is sent to your registered address in either June or October in the year following the income year. It provides information on the basis for taxation in Norway, such as
   taxable income, tax paid, if you have overpaid or underpaid tax, etc. The tax assessment will normally correspond with the information submitted in your personal tax return, but should always
   be double checked. For further information on the Norwegian tax system and regulations go to www.skatteetaten.no

International Schools in Trondheim

   Trondheim has two English-language international schools for children up to and including grade 10.

   For a city of its size, Trondheim offers a good variety of schooling alternatives for Norwegians and non-Norwegians alike. There are two English-language international schools: Birralee, which
   offers schooling based on the British National Curriculum, or the Trondheim International School, which is certified as an International Baccalaureate school for grades 1-10. At the moment, the
   Norwegian government subsidizes alternative schooling programmes such as international schools, so that the fees they charge are relatively low, typically around NOK 2000 per month.

   Parents can also choose a Steiner (Waldorf) School (in Norwegian), but the language of instruction there is Norwegian.

   You can also send your school-aged children to the Trondheim school system, where they'll be integrated into the local school classroom and offered special tutoring in Norwegian. Broadly
   speaking, the Norwegian school system is governed by a national curriculum; note that one surprise for some non-Norwegians is that Christian knowledge and religious and ethical education are a
   required part of schooling.

   Typically, the city of Trondheim also provides children of non-native residents language tutoring in the student's native language. Contact the principal of your school for more information
   about this.

Trondheim Immigration Office

   The Trondheim Immigration Office is located at the Trondheim Police Department in downtown Trondheim. They now also have a Facebook page with lots of useful information.

   The most important thing you need to know is that you must have an appointment made in advance if you must do anything related to visas or permits at the Immigration Office. This includes
   first-time visas, residence permit renewals and the like.

   The easiest way to get an appointment in advance is by using the Application Portal Norway, where you can create a user account and then apply for visas and residence permits online.  Once you
   have filed an application you will be given the opportunity to set up an appointment.

   A detailed description of the Application Portal is available from the Directorate of Immigration (UDI) website.

   If you are unable to access the Internet, you can go to the main Immigration Office, Counter D, which is co-located with the Trondheim Police Department and make an appointment there, but only
   between 9-11 a.m. from Monday through Thursday.

   Information and appointment times are also available by telephone at 73 89 94 40, but this number is only staffed on Mondays through Thursdays from 0900-1130, and the number is often busy.

   The address for the Immigration Office is Gryta 4, in downtown Trondheim.

     * Stipends to aid women in associate professor positions to become full professors.
     * NTNU mentoring programmes for women who are in recruited and associate professor positions.

   NTNU also has an action plan to promote gender equality, as well as an action plan to address sexual harassment (pdf).

Supercomputing facilities at NTNU

   High performance computing at NTNU is centred around a supercomputer called Njord, named after the Norwegian god who is the protector of seafarers and fishermen and who sends favourable winds
   and calm seas.

   Njord is an IBM p575+ interconnected with a high-bandwidth low-latency switch network (HPS). When it was installed in August of 2006, it was one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe,
   and doubled Norway's supercomputing capacity in one fell swoop. NTNU's researchers use the machine for a variety of projects, including helping with the study of quantum transport in magnetic
   semiconductors and bioinformatics. The Norwegian Meterological Institute also uses time on the machine to create more detailed and real-time weather forecasts.

   Designed for speed
   For those who are curious about the technical details, Njord has a total of 65 nodes partitioned into 59 compute nodes, 4 I/O nodes and 2 login nodes. All 59 compute nodes are shared memory
   nodes with 8 dual-core power5+ processors 1.9 Ghz. Four of the compute nodes have 128 GB memory, while the remaining 55 have 32 GB of memory. The system is well-suited for large-scale parallel
   MPI and OpenMP applications, as well as applications that combine these two communication paradigms.

   Computing cooperative
   Although Njord is happily ensconced at NTNU, all high performance computing in Norway is controlled by a cooperative called NOTUR, which ensures that computing time on the country's four
   supercomputers is properly allocated. You can read more about NOTUR, including about how to apply for computer time, on the consortium's own web pages.

NOTUR

   NOTUR, the Norwegian Metacenter for Computational Science, oversees the allocation of time for Norway's 4 high performance computers. In addition to NTNU's Njord, Norway is home to Hexagon, a
   Cray XT4 computer housed at the University of Bergen; Stallo, a Cluster Platform 3000 BL460c at the University of Tromsø; and Titan, a Sun X2200 at the University of Oslo. NTNU students and
   researchers can apply to NOTUR to use time on any of these machines as needed. For more information contact NOTUR at info@notur.no

International R&D cooperation

   The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) cooperates with selected partner countries in accordance with stipulated national priorities in Norway. Cooperation in research and
   education is established with about 200 universities all over the world. Our prioritized geographical areas are the EU, the USA, Japan and China. NTNU has proved to be an attractive partner
   either alone or together with our on-campus neighbour, SINTEF, which is Scandinavia's largest independent research institute.

   European projects
   NTNU is an active partner in the European Research Area, and has participated in the European Commission's Framework Programmes (FP) for Research and Technological Development since FP4.
   Participation in FP7 is one of the highest priority areas for the university. NTNU and SINTEF are together involved in a large majority of the European Technology Platforms that are supported
   by the European Commission. In FP6, NTNU is a contractual partner in about 60 projects, which have a total budget of EUR 250 million over a four-year period.
   Energy and Petroleum - Resources and Environment
   Our proximity to the large oil and gas fields in the North Sea/Norwegian Sea and our close cooperation with the companies operating these fields has over the years built up world-class research
   teams and education in this sector at NTNU. Today's focus on greenhouse gases and climate changes has created new research challenges for researchers in Trondheim to address together with
   industrial partners. The European Technology Platform ZEP (Zero Emission Fossil Fuel Power Plants) is a good example of such work. The mobility of researchers and transnational access to
   Research Infrastructures is a vital aspect of international research cooperation. Projects funded by the European Commission are designed to open up the scientific know-how and laboratory
   facilities in Europe for the benefit of the entire European research community. For example, ENGAS (Environmental Gas Management) has helped to put NTNU firmly on the international scientific
   map.
   The renowned Japanese research institute AIST (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology) is cooperating with NTNU and SINTEF to build up leading-edge research and
   education in four areas: sustainability, energy systems, nanotechnology and biotechnology. NTNU is also closely involved with the Kyoto International Forum for Environment and Energy which is
   an international arena for strategic cooperation to realize sustainable society inspired by the Kyoto protocol. Another example is the Transition to Sustainable Energy Services in Northern
   Europe project. This is energy research network brings together NTNU, MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden. This project focuses on the
   supply of sustainable energy to northern Europe. NTNU also cooperates in energy research with Tsinghua University, China. This work is concentrated on hydrogen and fuel cells, materials
   technology and energy conversion, water resources, as well as environmental issues.

   The European Aquaculture Technology Platform was initiated by SINTEF and NTNU, with the aim to gather European stakeholders in the field to define future research needs and a vision for the
   sector. NTNU's in-depth knowledge base and many years of industrial cooperation provided a firm basis for this initiative.
   NTNU is also involved in other European Commission-supported initiatives to stimulate transnational R&D cooperation in this sector. For example, HYDRALAB III provides transnational access to
   the Trondheim Marine Systems Research Infrastructure .There is also Design-ACT that is designing the Aquaculture Centre of Technology - to face the unmet needs in European aquaculture
   Marine research cooperation between NTNU and the University of Nagasaki, Japan is focused on aquaculture and the production of marine fry. There is also R&D cooperation in this sector between
   NTNU and the Ocean University of China in Qingdao.
   Materials technology
   Light metals have a long history at NTNU. This is due to the Norwegian aluminium industry. When used in cars, ships and aircraft there is a huge demand for light metals research and innovation.
   NTNU's prominent scientific position in this field has led to participation in several European Commission-funded projects and the national Centre for Research-based Innovation (SIMLab) with
   the close involvement of the European car industry. Another project that is important for this strategic area is the Kyoto International Forum for Environment and Energy (see above: energy)
   Medical Technology
   Both NTNU and SINTEF are members in the European Technology Platform on nanomedicine, which is based on cooperation between the main European stakeholders in industry and academia aiming for
   improved, more efficient, and affordable medical care. NTNU contributes with high-level competence in nanotechnology-based diagnostics. There is also cooperation in medical technology with
   Harvard/MIT that results in the exchange of professors, PhD and master's students in connection with joint research projects.

International R&D cooperation

   The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) cooperates with selected partner countries in accordance with stipulated national priorities in Norway. Cooperation in research and
   education is established with about 200 universities all over the world. Our prioritized geographical areas are the EU, the USA, Japan and China. NTNU has proved to be an attractive partner
   either alone or together with our on-campus neighbour, SINTEF, which is Scandinavia's largest independent research institute.

   European projects
   NTNU is an active partner in the European Research Area, and has participated in the European Commission's Framework Programmes (FP) for Research and Technological Development since FP4.
   Participation in FP7 is one of the highest priority areas for the university. NTNU and SINTEF are together involved in a large majority of the European Technology Platforms that are supported
   by the European Commission. In FP6, NTNU is a contractual partner in about 60 projects, which have a total budget of EUR 250 million over a four-year period.
   Energy and Petroleum - Resources and Environment
   Our proximity to the large oil and gas fields in the North Sea/Norwegian Sea and our close cooperation with the companies operating these fields has over the years built up world-class research
   teams and education in this sector at NTNU. Today's focus on greenhouse gases and climate changes has created new research challenges for researchers in Trondheim to address together with
   industrial partners. The European Technology Platform ZEP (Zero Emission Fossil Fuel Power Plants) is a good example of such work. The mobility of researchers and transnational access to
   Research Infrastructures is a vital aspect of international research cooperation. Projects funded by the European Commission are designed to open up the scientific know-how and laboratory
   facilities in Europe for the benefit of the entire European research community. For example, ENGAS (Environmental Gas Management) has helped to put NTNU firmly on the international scientific
   map.
   The renowned Japanese research institute AIST (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology) is cooperating with NTNU and SINTEF to build up leading-edge research and
   education in four areas: sustainability, energy systems, nanotechnology and biotechnology. NTNU is also closely involved with the Kyoto International Forum for Environment and Energy which is
   an international arena for strategic cooperation to realize sustainable society inspired by the Kyoto protocol. Another example is the Transition to Sustainable Energy Services in Northern
   Europe project. This is energy research network brings together NTNU, MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden. This project focuses on the
   supply of sustainable energy to northern Europe. NTNU also cooperates in energy research with Tsinghua University, China. This work is concentrated on hydrogen and fuel cells, materials
   technology and energy conversion, water resources, as well as environmental issues.

Why celebrate?

   Why celebrate our PhDs? A university's annual academic year is marked by two highpoints. The first, in the autumn, is the welcoming of new students, and the second, in the spring, is the award
   of PhD degrees.
   Students are the lifeblood of the university, and the reason why we are all here. When we celebrate the award of PhDs, we are formally recognizing that our efforts in education and research
   have borne fruit.

   In today's society, knowledge is both highly valued and extremely important. Universities play a key role in creating new knowledge and information. The research contributions that NTNU's newly
   minted PhDs have made have helped expand the boundaries of our knowlege and have developed and strengthened the foundations for research. Our PhDs have developed new insights and now head out
   into society to share their findings, using the most effective of delivery techniques, sharing themselves.

The Ethics Portal

   The Ethics Portal is a website for all NTNU employees, and focuses on ethical dilemmas relating to research and personnel issues.

   The aim is to stimulate ethical reflection at all levels at NTNU: by the individual employee/PhD candidate/student, by the various units, and by management at different levels in the
   organization.

   The points below present specific cases based on episodes and constellations of cases from NTNU. The presentation of these cases has been recast to some extent where this was necessary to
   protect anonymity. What the cases have in common is that they represent dilemmas and issues that are not easy to resolve by referring to ethical guidelines and regulations. You are welcome to
   use these cases as a starting point for discussion.

   Each case is followed by questions, comments, and relevant links to guidelines and regulations.

   The 10 focus points:

   1. Transparency and confidentiality

   2. Freedom of expression and loyalty

   3. Acceptable and unacceptable relationships

   4. Handling conflicts of interest

   5. Blowing the whistle on dishonesty and research fraud

   6. The research process: contracts and reporting routines

   7. Governance of the relationship between the supervisor and the PhD candidate/student

   8. Storage, use and publication of data and personal data

   9. The dilemmas of multidisciplinary work

   10. Approvals and notifications of research projects

Background to the Ethics Portal

   The main objective:
     * An Internet portal on ethics and research ethics has been created as a teaching and supervision resource for staff and students/ PhD candidates at NTNU.
     * The ethics portal is based on 10 focus points intended for three different user groups:
       - Novices / getting started
       - Users with a focus on particular problems or disciplines
       - Users with a specialized interest in ethics (networks, events, teaching, research, journals, people, news, links, and more)
     * The web pages of the Programme for Applied Ethics, easily accessible from the Ethics Portal, will be especially useful to the second, and in particular the third group of users.The focus
       points are based on specific cases from NTNU, and developed with reference to relevant regulations and other information resources.
     * The task of developing the Ethics Portal has been assigned to the Programme for Applied Ethics

   Two working groups have been involved. The first was a committee established by the University Central Research Committee through Astrid Lægreid in the autumn of 2006. From the autumn of 2008,
   a new group established by the director of the human resources division continued work on the material. Personnel matters were now included in the content. The Programme for Applied Ethics,
   represented by May Thorseth, has had the primary responsibility for the work.

   The result has a multidisciplinary and inter-faculty foundation, with contributions from professors/heads of departments, the doctoral candidates' organization DION, heads of sections, safety
   representatives, NTNU's legal adviser, vice-deans and pro-rectors. Heads of sections and DION have contributed in interviews, while the others have either been included in the working groups or
   as pilot testers. Those involved have given their consent for use of the cases and comments in anonymized form.

   Ethical reasons for the Ethics Portal
   In an ideal world we would not need research ethics -- all researchers would understand the need for compliance with certain standards, such as specifying the source of references, giving
   credit to co-workers, being open about sources of knowledge, obtaining consent from research subjects, etc. Identifying research ethics as a separate field is an acknowledgement that
   researchers do not live in an ideal world (even if Plato believed that philosophers could do so). There are two ways of looking at this: (1) It is regrettable that researchers do not act in
   line with their ideals, and must therefore submit to the introduction of external rules for their own activities. (2) It is good that researchers live in a world adapted to human reality, and
   do not blindly trust that no one makes mistakes.

   Our point of departure is that it is good for researchers to have an honest recognition of their fallibility. Then it is also reassuring to know that potential whistle-blowers and others can
   step in if necessary. We believe that, most of the time, the great majority of researchers do not make significant mistakes, and that most have a well-trained alarm system to alert them when
   they venture on to uncertain ground. They are not born with this alarm system; they acquire it through social and academic training during their period of study and subsequent recruitment
   phases.

   When the alarm does not sound automatically
   In other words, there is a need to focus on some key points in the plethora of written and unwritten rules for good research. The ethical perspective is an important aspect of good research in
   general. Good research means research of high quality. There are many criteria for evaluating the quality of research, but there is no invariable standard that applies in the same way to every
   subject. At the national level plan we have committees for research ethics in various disciplines, and at the regional/local level there are regional committees for evaluating research projects
   in medicine and health disciplines, but not for all subjects at this stage.

   Brief reflection on the intersection between law, ethics and morals
   The issue of high quality in research requires legal guidelines, and we have many of those. So many that researchers come to perceive them as a problem, both because it is difficult to keep
   track of them all, and because there are ethical and moral questions that cannot be answered exclusively by referring to the law. The most important issue, however, is: How to get researchers
   to produce qualitatively good research on the basis of the right motivation? This question directs a critical spotlight on the growing tendency toward external control without an inner sense of
   justice. An example is the difference between refraining from dishonesty because it carries penalties if you are discovered, and because it conflicts with the inherent research ethos of
   building up knowledge.

Department of Philosophy

   What is 'knowledge'? What is the difference between scholarly knowledge and other kinds of knowledge? What is a meaningful and good life for human beings? What is a just society? What is a work
   of art? What is beauty?

   Philosophy seeks to find rational and consistent answers to questions such as these through thinking and dialogue.

   When society changes, fundamental philosophical questions must be rephrased and reconsidered. For instance, transplant surgery and gene technology have provoked new questions about human
   identity, as well as critical debates about 'established truths' of 'what is right' and `what is wrong'. The development of art raises questions of what signifies a piece of art. Our
   traditional view of humanity is also challenged by research in fields such as biology, language, cognition and nervous systems.

   It is important to understand how different philosophers throughout the ages have expressed their questions, and how they have attempted to answer these questions. Therefore, the history of
   philosophy has a central place in the field of Philosophy.

   The Bachelor's degree in Philosophy comprises compulsory courses, which trace the history of Philosophy from ancient to modern times, introduce central themes and philosophers of Twentieth
   Century Philosophy and provide grounding in the logico-linguistic methods of contemporary analytical Philosophy and Philosophy of science. Students then take specialization courses, which at
   present are organised around three main topics or 'profiles': Ethics and Political Philosophy; Aesthetics, and Theoretical philosophy (some topics are: Metaphysics, Theory of knowledge and
   philosophy of science). In addition, the Department offers courses in other areas of Philosophy, which, together with a flexible curriculum, allows for a different or more general
   specialization profile. Our specialization courses can also be taken as part of a Bachelor's (or even Master's) degree with a main subject area other than Philosophy.

   The Master's degree is a two-year full-time study awarding 120 ECTS credits. The programme focuses on meta-theoretical and methodological aspects of Philosophy before the student embarks on
   supervised work culminating in the Master's thesis. Master's/Postgraduate students are also encouraged to make use of the specialization courses offered, in their areas of interest (see above).

   The Department is also responsible for the Introductory course in Philosophy. It is a compulsory introductory course for all students at Norwegian universities. Furthermore, the Department
   offers teaching in connection with the course Introduction to Neuroscience at the Faculty of Medicine and a Theory of Science course for PhD students at the Faculty of Humanities.

   Programmes of study:
     * Bachelor of Philosophy
     * Master of Philosophy
     * Master of Applied Ethics (Erasmus Mundus)
     * Examen philosophicum (In Norwegian)

   Do you have questions regarding the studies, please contact Rune Kristian Hansen (mail: rune.kristian.hansen@ntnu.no , phone: +47 73596538).

   Instituttet har tilknytning til Bioetisk forskergruppe som er en tverrfaglig sammensatt forskergruppe ved NTNU engasjert i bioetiske spørsmål av både medisinsk og ikke-medisinsk art. Gruppen
   har flere stipendiater og har blant annet hovedansvaret for seminarserien Bioetisk forum. Program for Anvendt etikk er et tverrfaglig program ved Filosofisk institutt som skal utvikle
   kompetansen i etikk blant ansatte og studenter ved NTNU. Tverrfaglighet skal være en ledestjerne i programmet. "Anvendt etikk" defineres som et møte mellom flere fag, der ulike former for
   fagkompetanse og etikkompetanse møtes. Aktiviteten forekommer størst innen medisinske og bioteknologiske forskningsmiljøer, men også innen mediefag og IT- / teknologifag pågår mange aktiviteter
   der etikk står sentralt.

It started with one computer...

   Fifty years ago, GIER, a coat-closet sized computer, came to Trondheim. It ushered the university into the digital age. In celebration of that singular event, the Faculty of Information
   Technology, Mathematics and Electrical Engineering has made a video that gives you an overview of just what GIER brought to Trondheim.

   100 years, and as engaged as ever!
   The NTNU University Library is the oldest scientific library in Norway, with roots back to the Royal Norwegian Society of Science and Letters in 1768. The next big leap in its development was
   the establishment of the library at NTH in 1912.
   It is this last, 100-year anniversary that we celebrate this year. From its simple beginnings, the University Library has developed into a modern academic library with a large selection of
   offerings. Library services are an important part of the university's research infrastructure and educational programmes. It is an inspiring challenge to continue to provide strong library
   services to NTNU's researchers and students. Lisbeth Tangen, Library Director

   Cristin-logo     Current Research Information System In Norway

   List a scientific publication in Cristin  (use your NTNU password)
   Search the Cristin database

All research results that have been entered into the Cristin database are linked to the individual researcher's Cristin profile.

What should be entered

The following types of results must be entered into the database:

     * Academic articles in journals or in academic series with an ISSN
     * Academic monographs
     * Academic articles in anthologies

   The organization that operates Cristin will conduct a central data import from the bibliographical data sources ISI Web of Science, Norart and BIBSYS. This means that the author affiliations in
   the publications should correspond to the people and affiliations that have already been entered into Cristin. It is essential that you enter your correct NTNU affiliation  when you submit a
   work for publication. If you as a researcher notice that your publications have not been included in the central data import, it is your responsibility to get them listed. In addition to these
   publications, other types of research results can be listed in Cristin: reports, abstracts, presentations, posters, exhibitions, videos, interviews, editorials, feature articles, book reviews
   and forms of artistic content.

How to register publications
Log in to Cristin using your NTNU credentials (make sure you pre-select your institution, NTNU). Click 'Research Results/NVI' and the sub-category 'Register result' and follow the process. The
following notes will help ensure that you enter your publication correctly:

     * Before registering a new publication, click on the link for publications in your own Cristin profile to make sure that it is not already registered or imported.
     * When you register a new publication, your affiliation must be entered in the same manner as in the publication itself. Click on the 'house' icon on the screen to change your affiliation.
     * Co-authors should be entered correctly, by listing their name/s and affiliation/s as written in the publication. If possible, choose the name with (P).
     * Include the DOI of your publication in the appropriate field whenever possible.

Tier 1 and 2 publications

If you publish in a lesser-known peer-reviewed journal or publisher, please ensure that the journal or publisher is recognized at the tier 1 or 2 level, using the Database for Statistics and Higher
Education. Not all journals are assigned a tier. Nominations for the listing of journals as tier 1 are handled by the Norwegian Social Sciences Data Services (NSD). Nominations of journals to be
promoted from tier 1 to tier 2 are handled by the Publications Board at the Norwegian Association of Higher Education Institutions (UHR) according to recommendations from national advisory boards for
each discipline.
Publication points
The registration of publications in Cristin generates points which are used by national assessment authorities as a basis for the evaluation of academic research, which is carried out on a
quantitative basis. This evaluation in turn provides information in determining national budget allocations to universities. In situations where there are several authors, the points are divided
between the authors.

   Logo for EndNote

   EndNote is reference management software that is freely available for students and employees at NTNU

   EndNote enables you to build your own personal reference library with correctly formatted and complete bibliographic references. The references can either be imported directly from the
   scientific databases you use or manually. You can retrieve and store references from most databases.

   When you are writing a manuscript, you can import references from your personal database and generate reference lists for your manuscript. You can also choose between hundreds of different
   referencing styles for your reference list.

   For user support and information about training seminars, please sign up for a course or contact the appropriate NTNU library branch.
