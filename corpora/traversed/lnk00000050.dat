   Answers to questions about the final application process

   Please note: Due to the huge number of applicants, we simply cannot confirm the arrival of individual documents or applications. If you wish to be certain your documents have arrived you may
   send them via a company that offers a tracking system or via registered mail.

Questions about the preliminary application

   What is the deadline?
   The deadline to submit a preliminary application is 1 December.

   Should I send a hard copy of the preliminary application through the regular mail?
   No, do not send a hard copy of the application. Please just register online.

   Do I need to submit any documents with the preliminary application?
   No, please do not send any documents at this stage.

   I am having trouble with the online form, I think there is something wrong because I cannot submit my preliminary application.
   First of all, please make sure that all the required information in your form has been correctly entered  - pay special attention to the dates, which if filled in incorrectly will cause
   problems. Dates must be written DD.MM.YYYY to be accepted by the form, and be aware that dates such as 31.09.1985 and 29.02.2011 are not in the online calendar and will not be accepted.
   Mistakes like these can derail your entire application, so double check. If you are certain that you have filled in all of the necessary information correctly, please try again and/or try again
   from a different computer/computer line and/or on a different day, as it may be a local problem.

   In addition, please make sure that the 'Other relevant information'/'remarks' section does not contain more than 300 characters, as you will get an error message if this section contains more
   characters than this.

   We do receive many applications every day from all over the world, so we know that the online form works. Thus it should be possible to submit an application if you have filled out all the
   information correctly.

   When can I expect a reply?
   Those who make it through the preliminary selection process will be sent a final application form by email no later than 1 January 2012.

   Will I get an answer if I am rejected?
   Yes, you will get an answer by email even if you are not selected.

   Can I apply for more than one programme?
   No, you cannot.
   My institution is not on the list of NTNU's formal cooperation agreements for the Quota Scheme.
   If your institution is not on the list, NTNU does NOT have an agreement with your institution or the agreement has expired. To renew or initiate an agreement you need to contact your relevant
   department/faculty/school at your home institution. Formal cooperation agreements can only be initiated at an institutional level.


Admission and rejection letters
As a rule, admission letters will be sent by email and by regular post in early May. Rejection letters will be sent by email by the end of May.

   Please note that due to the huge number of applicants, we cannot respond individually to people who want to know the results of the admissions process before we send the acceptance and
   rejection letters. We regret this, and wish all applicants the best of luck.

   I have still not received admisison letter by post. What do I do about applying for visa/ residence permit?
   The electronically generated admissions letter sent to you by email is valid and can be submitted as proof of your acceptance when you apply for a student visa to Norway. Please apply for a
   visa as soon as possible using your email confirmation of admission. The visa process can be time consuming and it is best to initiate it as soon as you have the necessary paperwork, including
   the email admissions letter.


Deadlines: 1 December vs. 1 February

   Your website states that the deadline is 1 December (15 January for joint nordic Master's programmes), however some websites mention a deadline of 1 February. Can I apply using the 1 February
   deadline?
   The 1 February deadline is only for applicants who have applied through the preliminary application before 1 December and who have received a final application form. Regrettably, we cannot
   accept new applications for international master's programmes after the 1 December deadline.

   I registered an online application for one programme, and now I want to change to another programme. Can I do this after the deadline?
   No, that is not possible. You can only apply for one programme on the preliminary application, and this alternative cannot be changed after the deadline, so make your selections carefully.

English language requirements:

   Does NTNU accept the copy of the original TOEFL/IELTS reccord or I must ask TOEFL/IELTS institution to send the original record to NTNU?
   We will accept a certified copy of your TOEFL/IELTS test result.

   I have no problem with preparing and sending the required documents by the deadline except for the English language certification, what do I do?
   You can send us additional documentation for the English language certification up until 1 March.

   I have a bachelor's degree that was taught entirely in English, does this exempt me from the TOEFL/IELTS test?
   No, not unless you have a degree in English (i.e. majoring in English), or you are from one of the countries listed as exempted. For English requirements, please visit this webpage.
   Which IELTS test is required for admission to an international master's programme -- the academic or general test?
   Both academic and general test results will be accepted.

   Do you accept institutional TOEFL tests?
   No, we do not.
   What is NTNU's TOEFL Department Code?
   The department code is 9652.

Motivation, recommendation, portfolio and CV:

   Should I provide a motivation letter and CV?
   Yes, please submit a CV and motivation letter.

   Do I have to provide a recommendation letter and how many must I provide? Does NTNU use a specific form for recommendation letters?
   Please submit two letters of recommendation.There is no particular form to be filled out, a regular letter will serve just fine. Please send the recommendation letters along with your
   application/other documents.

   Is a portfolio necessary to apply for an architecture programme? Also, does it improve my chances of admission if I send a portfolio even if my application does not require it?
   A portfolio is not mandatory, but may be beneficial to your application when applying for a master's in architecture.

Passport and personal information:

   I understand that I must submit certified copies of some pages of my passport, but does NTNU accept a photocopy of the first page of original passport or must I go to the notary office to have
   all the copies notarized?
   All copies will need to be officially certified by a public institution (such as a university) or a Notary Public in order for your application to be considered. We require certified copies of
   the pages of your passport showing your photo, date of birth, full name, gender and nationality. If there is other information that you are uncertain about, get it notarized.


   I don't have a passport, and I cannot obtain one until I can show the passport office some documentation of a final acceptance to NTNU. Can I send to you a certified copy of my national card?
   Can I submit my documents without including a copy of my passport?
   Yes, a certified copy of a valid national ID card is acceptable if you do not yet have a passport.

   However, note that we cannot process your application unless we receive some form of official ID document, so you must supply either a passport or some other form of national ID card. Your
   application will not be considered unless this is submitted.

   Unfortunately, my personal data in the application form has been filled in incorrectly, can I change/correct it?
   Yes, you can.

Financing:

   I have a bank statement from my sponsor which is now 2 months old, is that acceptable for the application process?
   Yes, that is acceptable, as long as the statement is no older than 3 months.

   How do I provide documentation when I want to use a private sponsor? What if I am going to finance myself?
   You have to submit a letter from your sponsor, confirming that he/ she is indeed willing to be your sponsor, as well as a bank balance statement, showing that the sponsor has the required
   amount of money available. If you are going to finance yourself, you must submit a certified copy of your bank statement, showing that you have the required amount in your account.
   The financial requirement is NOK 90 800 per year, but the master's degree programme lasts for two years. Do I need to show that I have NOK 90 800 or NOK 181 600?
   You will only need to show that you have NOK 90 800. Please note, however, that you will only get a residence permit for one year, and this must be renewed. With your application for renewal,
   you will have to show documentation that you have access to 90 800,-. once again.

Transcripts, records, diplomas:

   It is difficult or a problem for me to send a certificate from my higher secondary school, must I send this document?
   Yes, sorry, we do require a certified copy of your secondary education certificates or diploma.

   The application requirements state that educational documents should be sent directly by the school, but at the moment, our school does not provide this service to students. Is it possible for
   me to send you all of the documents personally?
   We will only accept transcripts and diploma sent in a sealed envelope directly from your university.

   The deadline for submitting my bachelor's diploma is  1 February, however, I will not finish my degree until June. What should I do?
   Please submit the transcripts that you have, as well as a list of the courses that you are currently enrolled in. We also need a confirmation from your university that you are expected to
   graduate in the summer of 2011. Please note that the final Bachelor's diploma must be sent to NTNU as soon as you receive it.

   The CDGDC may need more than 20 working days to verify all my documents after they received original documents, however the deadline for submitting everything is 1 February? The verification
   may not arrive by the deadline, what should I do?
   Please include copies of your educational documents with your application package and submit this within the deadline so that we can start processing your application. Then submit your
   documents to the CDGDC for verification, and we will accept a verification report from them even after the deadline.

   Does the High School diploma also need to be verified through the national agency?
   No, it does not.

   My school is on Christmas vacation, and it will not be possible for them to send the transcripts within the deadline the 1st of February. What do I do?

   You can send us a certified copy of your transcripts/diploma along with your application package, and ask your university to send the transcripts once they are back. You will not be able to
   receive admission unless we receive the educational documents directly from your university

   My University can send my educational documents, but they are not in English. Can I send you the translations myself?
   Yes, please get the educational documents translated by an official translator and send this yourself. You should in addition ask your university to send the educational documents directly.

   I can send you the educational documents from my university; however my high school does not provide this service. Can I send these documents myself?
   Please include these in your application package and send them yourself.

   I'm an applicant from China. I should send my diploma and transcripts to CDGDC but I haven't graduated so I don't have a diploma. What should I do?
   Please include a copy of your transcript and a confirmation that you are expected to graduate in 2012 in your application package. Then send your transcript to CDGDC for verification. We will
   receive a verification report directly from CDGDC. Please also send us your final diploma as soon as you get it.

Other questions:

   I have been turned down for the final application, could you please help me in looking at my preliminary application and tell me what made me unqualified?
   As much as we would like to help, we do not have the capacity to provide individual counselling or check each individual applicant's form, due to the huge number of applications we receive
   every year. However, in most cases, the reason for the rejection is that the applicant's grades simply are not high enough to match the competition for the places we offer. You can read more
   about requirements for international master's programmes, but note that due to the limited number of seats, admission to NTNU is always very difficult. You can also post a query to students who
   have been accepted to NTNU on our Facebook page.

   Can you send me an email confirmation that you have received my documents?
   No, again, due to the huge number of applicants, we simply cannot confirm the arrival of individual documents. If you wish to be certain your documents have arrived you may send them via a
   company that offers a tracking system or via registered mail.

   May I bring my wife/ husband and children with me?
   For information regarding family immigration, please visit UDI's webpage. Please note that we only offer single rooms for admitted students. If you plan to bring your family you must arrange
   for accommodation on your own.

   Can I fill out the application electronically, or should I fill it out by hand?
   Both are ok, as long as you remember to sign the form that you submit.

Do I  have to get a notary office to certify all of my documents?
All copies will need to be officially certified in order for your application to be considered.
Questions about the final application process:

   What is NTNU's organization number?
   NTNU's organization number is: 974767880
   What is the name of the Norwegian bank where I should transfer money when I apply for a visa?
   The name of the bank is DNB NOR, NO-0021 OSLO
   What shall I use as my Trondheim address when I apply for a visa?
   You should use this address: Moholt Student Village, 7050 Trondheim, Norway
   How can I arrange for a room at the student village?
   The Office of International Relations at NTNU will book a room for master's students who need a single room. Once you have returned the acknowledgement form and informed us that you need a
   single room, we will book a room for you. Please note: You will receive a contract by e-mail from the student village in June. Please check your e-mail every day in June to see if you have
   received the contract. All necessary information regarding accommodation will be included in the contract. Be aware that you have to pay a deposit (NOK 5000,-) and sign the contract, as stated
   in the contract you will receive, by the deadline.If you do not act in accordance with the contract, your booking will be cancelled and you must then find private accommodation in Trondheim. A
   room in Trondheim can be difficult to obtain and normally costs more than NOK 4000,- per month.
   Can I defer my admission until next year?
   No, you cannot. If you for some reason do not accept your offer, you must apply again next year. Please inform us as soon as possible if you decide not to accept.
   How do I return the acknowledgement form?
   Please send the signed and scanned acknowledgment form to us by the deadline stated in your admission letter. Do not send the form by regular mail. Please send the email to the appropriate
   programme coordinator, anette.moen@ntnu.no for Quota or oddrun.maao@ntnu.no for individual funding.

   I am having trouble transferring money from my home country, but the admission letter says the money must be transferred by the students themselves. Is it possible to have someone else transfer
   money for me?
   Yes, someone else can transfer this money for you; however, it needs to be clear from the transfer which student the transfer is intended for - the student's name will need to be clearly
   stated.

    How do I apply for a visa/ residence permit?
   Please see www.udi.no and apply as soon as you have received your admission letter by email.

Where can I find out more about what it is like to live in Trondheim and in Norway?

   You can find some fun information about Trondheim, or information about the more practical aspects of living in Trondheim and Norway on the International Researcher Support webpages. Although
   many of these pages are aimed at PhD candidates, much of the information may be relevant to master's students as well.
