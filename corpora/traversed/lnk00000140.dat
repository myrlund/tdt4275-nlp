Financing and scholarships

   However, students do need to cover their living expenses, including housing, books, food and travel. What follows is a list of the main funding alternatives available to international students.

                                                                                                                    Name/programme

Fees

   NTNU does not charge tuition fees, even for international students. This is true of all Norwegian universities. Students may be required to pay a semester fee, but this typically amounts to
   less than 500 NOK per semester.
