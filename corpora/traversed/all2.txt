   Climate events can drive high-arctic population dynamics
   (17.01.2013) Climate change is known to affect the population dynamics of single species, such as reindeer or caribou, but the effect of climate at the community level has been much more

   (02.01.2013) Your morning cup of coffee just might be contributing to species extinction, says Edgar Hertwich, director of NTNU's Industrial Ecology Programme, in a commentary for Nature
   magazine. His pointed commentary won the professor a place as one of the publication's top commentaries for 2012.

   Applying to NTNU to earn an undergraduate or ordinary master's degree is easy by using the centralized application processing centre called NUCAS, the Norwegian Universities and Colleges
   Admission Service (Samordnet opptak). Applications for international master's and PhD programmes are made directly to the university. Here's what you need to know.
   The deadline for foreign student applications is March 1, while for students with high school degrees from a Nordic country, the deadline is April 15. The online application form at NUCAS is
   available from February 1 of the year you wish to attend university, and can be used to apply for bachelor's and integrated master's degrees (a five year study programme which results in a
   master's, with no intermediate bachelor's degree), where the language of instruction is in Norwegian. In fact, all of NUCAS's important forms are in Norwegian, because if you don't understand
   Norwegian, you will need to use a different application procedure. A complete list (in Norwegian) of all of NTNU's programmes that use the NUCAS application form can be found here.

   If you want to study in Norway for an undergraduate degree but don't speak Norwegian, NTNU offers two different Norwegian language courses that will enable you to meet the language
   If you have the required undergraduate or graduate training but don't speak Norwegian, you can apply directly to NTNU for the following:
   In general, admission to NTNU is highly competitive, particularly for engineering, architecture, and medicine. A strong grade average is an essential prerequisite to secure a place. Medicine,
   Applying to NTNU is a two-step process:
     * First, you need to fill out the NUCAS application form online (in Norwegian), which includes selecting the courses of study you wish to pursue, and the university/college where you want to
       study. You can choose as many as 10 different courses of study. A searchable list of courses and programmes is available here (only in Norwegian). The deadline for students educated outside
       of Scandinavia is March 1.
     * Then, when your application is registered, NUCAS will send you a form called an omslagsark (application file) in the post. This is where you provide information about your education, with
       Scandinavian language, you will have to provide an authorized translation. You should receive this form no later than June 1. If you have not received it by this date, contact NUCAS
       immediately, and no later than June 10. The omslagsark must be returned to NUCAS before July 1.
   Places are offered to students by July 20. This process assumes that the student either is currently residing in Norway, or is eligible for Norwegian residency. Students who live abroad and who
   want to apply using this process may find that the late notification date makes it difficult to obtain a student residency permit in a timely manner.
   Certain departments/programmes have different deadlines, so it is best to check the web sites for the programmes you are interested in.
   Not all NTNU programmes use the NUCAS application process. A complete desciption of the programmes where the language of instruction is in Norwegian but where the application is made directly

   Questions about the preliminary application
   Answers to questions about the final application process
   Please note: Due to the huge number of applicants, we simply cannot confirm the arrival of individual documents or applications. If you wish to be certain your documents have arrived you may
   send them via a company that offers a tracking system or via registered mail.
Questions about the preliminary application
   What is the deadline?
   The deadline to submit a preliminary application is 1 December.
   Should I send a hard copy of the preliminary application through the regular mail?
   No, do not send a hard copy of the application. Please just register online.
   Do I need to submit any documents with the preliminary application?
   I am having trouble with the online form, I think there is something wrong because I cannot submit my preliminary application.
   First of all, please make sure that all the required information in your form has been correctly entered  - pay special attention to the dates, which if filled in incorrectly will cause
   problems. Dates must be written DD.MM.YYYY to be accepted by the form, and be aware that dates such as 31.09.1985 and 29.02.2011 are not in the online calendar and will not be accepted.
   Mistakes like these can derail your entire application, so double check. If you are certain that you have filled in all of the necessary information correctly, please try again and/or try again
   from a different computer/computer line and/or on a different day, as it may be a local problem.
   In addition, please make sure that the 'Other relevant information'/'remarks' section does not contain more than 300 characters, as you will get an error message if this section contains more
   characters than this.
   We do receive many applications every day from all over the world, so we know that the online form works. Thus it should be possible to submit an application if you have filled out all the
   When can I expect a reply?
   Those who make it through the preliminary selection process will be sent a final application form by email no later than 1 January 2012.
   Will I get an answer if I am rejected?
   Yes, you will get an answer by email even if you are not selected.
   Can I apply for more than one programme?
   My institution is not on the list of NTNU's formal cooperation agreements for the Quota Scheme.
   If your institution is not on the list, NTNU does NOT have an agreement with your institution or the agreement has expired. To renew or initiate an agreement you need to contact your relevant
   department/faculty/school at your home institution. Formal cooperation agreements can only be initiated at an institutional level.
As a rule, admission letters will be sent by email and by regular post in early May. Rejection letters will be sent by email by the end of May.
   Please note that due to the huge number of applicants, we cannot respond individually to people who want to know the results of the admissions process before we send the acceptance and
   rejection letters. We regret this, and wish all applicants the best of luck.
   The electronically generated admissions letter sent to you by email is valid and can be submitted as proof of your acceptance when you apply for a student visa to Norway. Please apply for a
   visa as soon as possible using your email confirmation of admission. The visa process can be time consuming and it is best to initiate it as soon as you have the necessary paperwork, including
   the email admissions letter.
   Your website states that the deadline is 1 December (15 January for joint nordic Master's programmes), however some websites mention a deadline of 1 February. Can I apply using the 1 February
   The 1 February deadline is only for applicants who have applied through the preliminary application before 1 December and who have received a final application form. Regrettably, we cannot
   accept new applications for international master's programmes after the 1 December deadline.
   I registered an online application for one programme, and now I want to change to another programme. Can I do this after the deadline?
   No, that is not possible. You can only apply for one programme on the preliminary application, and this alternative cannot be changed after the deadline, so make your selections carefully.
   Does NTNU accept the copy of the original TOEFL/IELTS reccord or I must ask TOEFL/IELTS institution to send the original record to NTNU?
   We will accept a certified copy of your TOEFL/IELTS test result.
   I have no problem with preparing and sending the required documents by the deadline except for the English language certification, what do I do?
   You can send us additional documentation for the English language certification up until 1 March.
   I have a bachelor's degree that was taught entirely in English, does this exempt me from the TOEFL/IELTS test?
   No, not unless you have a degree in English (i.e. majoring in English), or you are from one of the countries listed as exempted. For English requirements, please visit this webpage.
   Which IELTS test is required for admission to an international master's programme -- the academic or general test?
   Should I provide a motivation letter and CV?
   Yes, please submit a CV and motivation letter.
   Do I have to provide a recommendation letter and how many must I provide? Does NTNU use a specific form for recommendation letters?
   Please submit two letters of recommendation.There is no particular form to be filled out, a regular letter will serve just fine. Please send the recommendation letters along with your
   Is a portfolio necessary to apply for an architecture programme? Also, does it improve my chances of admission if I send a portfolio even if my application does not require it?
   A portfolio is not mandatory, but may be beneficial to your application when applying for a master's in architecture.
   I understand that I must submit certified copies of some pages of my passport, but does NTNU accept a photocopy of the first page of original passport or must I go to the notary office to have
   all the copies notarized?
   All copies will need to be officially certified by a public institution (such as a university) or a Notary Public in order for your application to be considered. We require certified copies of
   the pages of your passport showing your photo, date of birth, full name, gender and nationality. If there is other information that you are uncertain about, get it notarized.

   Yes, a certified copy of a valid national ID card is acceptable if you do not yet have a passport.

   You have to submit a letter from your sponsor, confirming that he/ she is indeed willing to be your sponsor, as well as a bank balance statement, showing that the sponsor has the required
   amount of money available. If you are going to finance yourself, you must submit a certified copy of your bank statement, showing that you have the required amount in your account.
   The financial requirement is NOK 90 800 per year, but the master's degree programme lasts for two years. Do I need to show that I have NOK 90 800 or NOK 181 600?

   documents to the CDGDC for verification, and we will accept a verification report from them even after the deadline.
   Does the High School diploma also need to be verified through the national agency?
   My school is on Christmas vacation, and it will not be possible for them to send the transcripts within the deadline the 1st of February. What do I do?
   You can send us a certified copy of your transcripts/diploma along with your application package, and ask your university to send the transcripts once they are back. You will not be able to
   receive admission unless we receive the educational documents directly from your university

   I have been turned down for the final application, could you please help me in looking at my preliminary application and tell me what made me unqualified?
   As much as we would like to help, we do not have the capacity to provide individual counselling or check each individual applicant's form, due to the huge number of applications we receive
   every year. However, in most cases, the reason for the rejection is that the applicant's grades simply are not high enough to match the competition for the places we offer. You can read more
   about requirements for international master's programmes, but note that due to the limited number of seats, admission to NTNU is always very difficult. You can also post a query to students who
   Can you send me an email confirmation that you have received my documents?
   No, again, due to the huge number of applicants, we simply cannot confirm the arrival of individual documents. If you wish to be certain your documents have arrived you may send them via a
   company that offers a tracking system or via registered mail.
   For information regarding family immigration, please visit UDI's webpage. Please note that we only offer single rooms for admitted students. If you plan to bring your family you must arrange

   The name of the bank is DNB NOR, NO-0021 OSLO
   What shall I use as my Trondheim address when I apply for a visa?
   How can I arrange for a room at the student village?
   The Office of International Relations at NTNU will book a room for master's students who need a single room. Once you have returned the acknowledgement form and informed us that you need a
   single room, we will book a room for you. Please note: You will receive a contract by e-mail from the student village in June. Please check your e-mail every day in June to see if you have
   received the contract. All necessary information regarding accommodation will be included in the contract. Be aware that you have to pay a deposit (NOK 5000,-) and sign the contract, as stated
   in the contract you will receive, by the deadline.If you do not act in accordance with the contract, your booking will be cancelled and you must then find private accommodation in Trondheim. A
   room in Trondheim can be difficult to obtain and normally costs more than NOK 4000,- per month.
   Can I defer my admission until next year?
   How do I return the acknowledgement form?
   Please send the signed and scanned acknowledgment form to us by the deadline stated in your admission letter. Do not send the form by regular mail. Please send the email to the appropriate

   I am having trouble transferring money from my home country, but the admission letter says the money must be transferred by the students themselves. Is it possible to have someone else transfer
   Yes, someone else can transfer this money for you; however, it needs to be clear from the transfer which student the transfer is intended for - the student's name will need to be clearly
    How do I apply for a visa/ residence permit?

   You can find some fun information about Trondheim, or information about the more practical aspects of living in Trondheim and Norway on the International Researcher Support webpages. Although
   many of these pages are aimed at PhD candidates, much of the information may be relevant to master's students as well.

   Questions about the preliminary application
   Answers to questions about the final application process
   Please note: Due to the huge number of applicants, we simply cannot confirm the arrival of individual documents or applications. If you wish to be certain your documents have arrived you may
   send them via a company that offers a tracking system or via registered mail.
Questions about the preliminary application
   What is the deadline?
   The deadline to submit a preliminary application is 1 December.
   Should I send a hard copy of the preliminary application through the regular mail?
   No, do not send a hard copy of the application. Please just register online.
   Do I need to submit any documents with the preliminary application?
   I am having trouble with the online form, I think there is something wrong because I cannot submit my preliminary application.
   First of all, please make sure that all the required information in your form has been correctly entered  - pay special attention to the dates, which if filled in incorrectly will cause
   problems. Dates must be written DD.MM.YYYY to be accepted by the form, and be aware that dates such as 31.09.1985 and 29.02.2011 are not in the online calendar and will not be accepted.
   Mistakes like these can derail your entire application, so double check. If you are certain that you have filled in all of the necessary information correctly, please try again and/or try again
   from a different computer/computer line and/or on a different day, as it may be a local problem.
   In addition, please make sure that the 'Other relevant information'/'remarks' section does not contain more than 300 characters, as you will get an error message if this section contains more
   characters than this.
   We do receive many applications every day from all over the world, so we know that the online form works. Thus it should be possible to submit an application if you have filled out all the
   When can I expect a reply?
   Those who make it through the preliminary selection process will be sent a final application form by email no later than 1 January 2012.
   Will I get an answer if I am rejected?
   Yes, you will get an answer by email even if you are not selected.
   Can I apply for more than one programme?
   My institution is not on the list of NTNU's formal cooperation agreements for the Quota Scheme.
   If your institution is not on the list, NTNU does NOT have an agreement with your institution or the agreement has expired. To renew or initiate an agreement you need to contact your relevant
   department/faculty/school at your home institution. Formal cooperation agreements can only be initiated at an institutional level.
As a rule, admission letters will be sent by email and by regular post in early May. Rejection letters will be sent by email by the end of May.
   Please note that due to the huge number of applicants, we cannot respond individually to people who want to know the results of the admissions process before we send the acceptance and
   rejection letters. We regret this, and wish all applicants the best of luck.
   The electronically generated admissions letter sent to you by email is valid and can be submitted as proof of your acceptance when you apply for a student visa to Norway. Please apply for a
   visa as soon as possible using your email confirmation of admission. The visa process can be time consuming and it is best to initiate it as soon as you have the necessary paperwork, including
   the email admissions letter.
   Your website states that the deadline is 1 December (15 January for joint nordic Master's programmes), however some websites mention a deadline of 1 February. Can I apply using the 1 February
   The 1 February deadline is only for applicants who have applied through the preliminary application before 1 December and who have received a final application form. Regrettably, we cannot
   accept new applications for international master's programmes after the 1 December deadline.
   I registered an online application for one programme, and now I want to change to another programme. Can I do this after the deadline?
   No, that is not possible. You can only apply for one programme on the preliminary application, and this alternative cannot be changed after the deadline, so make your selections carefully.
   Does NTNU accept the copy of the original TOEFL/IELTS reccord or I must ask TOEFL/IELTS institution to send the original record to NTNU?

   I have no problem with preparing and sending the required documents by the deadline except for the English language certification, what do I do?
   You can send us additional documentation for the English language certification up until 1 March.
   I have a bachelor's degree that was taught entirely in English, does this exempt me from the TOEFL/IELTS test?
   No, not unless you have a degree in English (i.e. majoring in English), or you are from one of the countries listed as exempted. For English requirements, please visit this webpage.
   Which IELTS test is required for admission to an international master's programme -- the academic or general test?
   Should I provide a motivation letter and CV?
   Yes, please submit a CV and motivation letter.
   Do I have to provide a recommendation letter and how many must I provide? Does NTNU use a specific form for recommendation letters?
   Please submit two letters of recommendation.There is no particular form to be filled out, a regular letter will serve just fine. Please send the recommendation letters along with your
   Is a portfolio necessary to apply for an architecture programme? Also, does it improve my chances of admission if I send a portfolio even if my application does not require it?
   A portfolio is not mandatory, but may be beneficial to your application when applying for a master's in architecture.
   I understand that I must submit certified copies of some pages of my passport, but does NTNU accept a photocopy of the first page of original passport or must I go to the notary office to have

   Please be aware that the information in this webpage can change, so check back often for updates.
   The Office of International Relations at NTNU is responsible for allocating accommodation for international students. All international students who have applied for an exchange period at NTNU
   will receive information about housing from the Office of International Relations before their arrival.
   Once you applied for an exchange period at NTNU before the deadline, you automatically applied for housing (unless you specified in the form that you will arrange for housing on your own). You
   Unfortunately, NTNU cannot guarantee housing for all incoming exchange students. Accepted exchange students from countries outside of the EU/EEA are guaranteed housing due to visa regulations.
   All students who have applied for studies at NTNU in the fall semester will be informed about housing in time before their arrival (second half of June).
   Students who have applied within the deadline ( May 1^st for the fall semester / October 1^st for the spring semester) and have been accepted, will be prioritized for housing. This does not
   mean, however, that you are guaranteed housing. If you for some reason applied after the deadline you will therefore not be prioritized for housing since students who applied before the
   deadline will be first in line when the rooms are being allocated. This means that if there are vacant rooms at the student village after we have allocated available rooms we may however give
   you a room. But be aware that this is not very likely.
   Due to the fact that we have a lot of exchange students at NTNU and not enough rooms available at the student villages, the Office of International Relations cannot allocate housing for PhD's.
   However, PhD's from the Quota programme and HEC-students financed by SiU are exempted from this rule. Otherwise, though, in general if you are a PhD student, you are considered an NTNU
   employee, and there are different programmes to help you with housing which you can read about here.

   Norwegian University of Science and Technology
     * Go to norwegian version: http://www.ntnu.no/studier/infprg
   The IFUS programme is a full-year course of study designed to teach Norwegian to international students who wish to pursue a degree at NTNU.
   Although NTNU offers more than 30 international masters programmes, all of our bachelor's programmes and a significant number of master's programmes are taught in Norwegian. If you want to
   pursue one of these degrees, you need to fulfill the univerity's Norwegian language requirements as well as other programme-specific requirements. Successful completion of the IFUS course
   IFUS programme graduates are also guaranteed a place in one of the university's bachelor's or master's courses (with certain exceptions, see below) if you have applied directly from abroad. If
   you already live in Norway, the university cannot guarantee you admission after you graduate from IFUS. Instead, you must compete with other Norwegian students for a place at NTNU by applying
   through NUCAS, the Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service. You can read more about the application procedure for students already resident in Norway lower on this page.
   As a IFUS student, you learn the skills you need to master written and spoken Norwegian in academic as well as everyday situations. We also introduce you to Norwegian culture and society.
   The course begins with the basics of Norwegian grammar, syntax and phonetics, and progresses to expanding your vocabulary and knowledge of idiomatic expressions. You also have access to
   listening and pronunciation exercises in the language laboratory. IFUS is worth 60 credits in the Norwegian system. Lectures start in August and last 28 weeks, with 12 hours of class
   If you apply to IFUS directly from abroad and are accepted to the programme, you are also guaranteed admission to continue your studies at NTNU. This means that you must list a minimum of three
   alternative degree programmes on your application that you would like to pursue at NTNU. Your admissions letter for the IFUS programme will also include information about where you have been
   accepted to study after you have completed IFUS. However, you cannot apply to an International Master's programme, medicine or professional studies in psychology, music and fine arts through
   the IFUS program.
   you a place in the programme. Unfortunately you will not be able to apply for financial aid through the Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund, or other government and university grants and
   loans. (The only exception is for applicants married to Norwegian citizens who may qualify for support from the State Educational Loan Fund.)
   Who can apply?
   If you meet the minimum entrance requirements, and can document the ability to finance your studies, you are welcome to apply. However, IFUS is primarily for applicants who intend to study at
   NTNU after the completion of the programme. You may also apply if you have an agreement with your home institution to take this course as part of your studies. But note that you cannot have
   attended any previous Norwegian courses, or have any prior knowledge of the language.
   If you currently live in Norway, you may apply to IFUS, but we can only accept you if the course has places available after we have accepted eligible students who have applied from abroad.

   The IFUS programme is a full-year course of study designed to teach Norwegian to international students who wish to pursue a degree at NTNU.
   Although NTNU offers more than 30 international masters programmes, all of our bachelor's programmes and a significant number of master's programmes are taught in Norwegian. If you want to
   pursue one of these degrees, you need to fulfill the univerity's Norwegian language requirements as well as other programme-specific requirements. Successful completion of the IFUS course
   IFUS programme graduates are also guaranteed a place in one of the university's bachelor's or master's courses (with certain exceptions, see below) if you have applied directly from abroad. If
   you already live in Norway, the university cannot guarantee you admission after you graduate from IFUS. Instead, you must compete with other Norwegian students for a place at NTNU by applying
   through NUCAS, the Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service. You can read more about the application procedure for students already resident in Norway lower on this page.
   As a IFUS student, you learn the skills you need to master written and spoken Norwegian in academic as well as everyday situations. We also introduce you to Norwegian culture and society.
   The course begins with the basics of Norwegian grammar, syntax and phonetics, and progresses to expanding your vocabulary and knowledge of idiomatic expressions. You also have access to
   listening and pronunciation exercises in the language laboratory. IFUS is worth 60 credits in the Norwegian system. Lectures start in August and last 28 weeks, with 12 hours of class
   If you apply to IFUS directly from abroad and are accepted to the programme, you are also guaranteed admission to continue your studies at NTNU. This means that you must list a minimum of three
   alternative degree programmes on your application that you would like to pursue at NTNU. Your admissions letter for the IFUS programme will also include information about where you have been
   accepted to study after you have completed IFUS. However, you cannot apply to an International Master's programme, medicine or professional studies in psychology, music and fine arts through
   the IFUS program.

   loans. (The only exception is for applicants married to Norwegian citizens who may qualify for support from the State Educational Loan Fund.)
   Who can apply?
   If you meet the minimum entrance requirements, and can document the ability to finance your studies, you are welcome to apply. However, IFUS is primarily for applicants who intend to study at
   NTNU after the completion of the programme. You may also apply if you have an agreement with your home institution to take this course as part of your studies. But note that you cannot have
   attended any previous Norwegian courses, or have any prior knowledge of the language.
   If you currently live in Norway, you may apply to IFUS, but we can only accept you if the course has places available after we have accepted eligible students who have applied from abroad.

   NTNU is a Norwegian university with a strong international presence. That means our students and staff must be able to communicate clearly in English.
   English is a compulsory part of Norwegian schooling, so practically every Norwegian has a working knowledge of the language. And because English is very often the language of academic research,
   NTNU requires its ordinary degree students to be proficient in English as well as Norwegian. Exchange students, and students pursuing an international master's or PhD programme generally do not
   need to comply with the university's Norwegian requirement (although all are welcomed to learn Norwegian), but they do have to be able to speak English. Here's a summary of the university's

   If you want to learn Norwegian, NTNU and other institutions offer various Norwegian language courses. Anyone who has been hired into a permanent position at NTNU who does not already speak
   Norwegian or another Scandinavian language is required to master Norwegian (or another Scandinavian language) within three years of his or her start date. This means being able to communicate
   at "level 3" (or the equivalent) of the Norwegian for Foreigners course given by the Department of Language and Communication Studies.

    1. What is a joint degree?
    2. What is a cotutelle agreement?
1. What is a joint degree?
   Joint degree means that two (or more) institutions jointly initiate a doctoral degree programme leading to a joint degree. The joint degree can be documented through a joint diploma from the
   institutions or through a diploma from each of the institutions.
2. What is a cotutelle agreement?
   Cotutelle is an agreement on joint supervision on the doctoral degree level. The programme originated in France, hence the term cotutelle (as in co-tutoring). Such agreements can be entered
   into between the two cooperating institutions, the PhD candidate and the candidate's supervisors. The cotutelle agreement regulates enrolment, supervision and the evaluation of the candidate's
   doctoral degree dissertation. A cotutelle agreement must always be entered into on the individual level, but institutional agreements can also be made on cotutelle cooperation. The candidate
   receives a diploma from each of the institutions.
   promote NTNU's international ambitions. In NTNU's strategy document "NTNU 2020 Internasjonalt fremragende" (NTNU 2020 - Internationally Outstanding), the performance target for 2010 is that the
   number of joint degree agreements with international universities will increase by 70 per cent compared to 2007. This also applies to joint degrees on the PhD level. Joint degrees and study
   programmes with universities that are among the 20 best in Europe are defined as a target for 2020. Establishing joint degrees is also an explicit goal in the Bologna process.
   Establishing joint degrees means that several academic environments that on their own may be relatively small can offer study programmes together which they could not have managed to offer on
   their own. The primary goal of joint degrees should be to raise the quality of both the training and the research in the academic field in question and should provide the institution with added
   As a stage in international cooperation and the intention that PhD candidates should have a research stay at an institution abroad, an agreement on joint supervision (cotutelle agreement) will
   formalise this collaborative effort. For the candidate, it will be beneficial to have documentation that he or she has education from more than one institution. The candidate will also have
   "Such an agreement is as a minimum to cover enrolment, funding, academic training, supervision, residency requirements at the institutions, reporting requirements, the language and structure of
   the thesis, its evaluation, the award of the degree, the issue of the certificate and the ownership of intellectual property rights to the results."
   The PhD training must have a scope of three years of normal study time, and the candidate must be enrolled in both institutions. It is a requirement that the entire dissertation and its
    1. NTNU may enter into agreements on cotutelle cooperation on the PhD level with universities abroad.
    2. The agreement must be signed by the two supervisors, the Dean, the PhD candidate and the Rector.
    3. The candidate must be enrolled in both institutions. The academic basis for enrolment must be a Master's degree or similar.
    4. The PhD training must have a scope of three years of normal studies.
    6. The training part must satisfy the requirements of both institutions.
    7. The candidate must have a period of stay at both institutions. The agreement should specify when the candidate is to stay at each institution.
    8. The candidate must have a place to work, access to laboratory facilities and other infrastructure at each institution.
    9. The dissertation must have the logo of both institutions, and the cooperation agreement must be specified.
   11. The agreement must regulate the composition of the assessment committee.
   12. For the public presentation of the dissertation, the rules that are in force at the institution where the presentation is to be given must be complied with.
   13. The candidate shall receive a diploma from each institution.
   14. Both institutions shall have the right to use the dissertation and the results in their education, training and research.
   The guidelines apply in the same way to joint degrees where a number of institutions agree to establish a joint doctoral degree programme. With joint degrees, the candidate may receive a
   diploma from each institution or a joint diploma.
       the administration's support with respect to entering into a cooperation agreement with the institution in question.
    2. After receiving positive confirmation from the administration, negotiations are then initiated by the academic communities. The academic community is urged to contact the Department of
       Academic Affairs early in the process to obtain advice and guidance.
       Contact persons at the Department of Academic Affairs:
    3. One of the institution's standard agreement templates must be used, but both institutions' cooperation requirements must be satisfied.
    4. When the agreement has been drawn up, the faculty sends it together with the necessary information to the Department of Academic Affairs, which presents the agreement and the faculty's
       information to the Rector. The Department of Academic Affairs also submits a brief statement on whether the agreement is in accordance with NTNU's guidelines.

   To be eligible, you must also have stayed at least one year in your home country directly prior to when you plan to undertake your education to NTNU. This means that you cannot apply for
   financial support from another country than your own.
   The few Quota seats available, compared to the high number of applicants competing, make this source of funding extremely competitive.
   Due to few Quota Seats available, not all MSc/MPhil programmes will be allocated with Quota Seats, the decision will be made internally at NTNU in November.
   Students should still apply for the programme they are interested in and qualified for, but unfortunately, we can not guarantee that all programmes will be allocated Quota Seats.

   On 12 October 2006, the Board of NTNU passed Guidelines concerning the action to be taken in cases of students cheating or attempting to cheat at examinations at NTNU. This extract from these
   Guidelines is written to give students important information about this matter.NTNU regards cheating as a serious matter with grave consequences when a student is even suspected of cheating.
   Failing to respect the work of others by not citing sources can lead to an examination being failed and even expulsion from NTNU and all higher education in Norway for up to one year.
   NTNU defines cheating as actions that are in conflict with the examination regulations that lead to the results being more favourably judged than would otherwise be the case. This is a broad
   definition that includes gross negligence. The following examples clarify what NTNU can regard as cheating:
     * An examination answer paper with all or some of the text from the Internet that is presented as the student's own work
     * An examination answer paper with all or some of the text used by someone else at a previous examination
     * An examination answer paper with all or some of the text used by the student at a previous examination
     * An examination answer paper with all or some of the text written by someone else
     * Work that is handed in as the student's own work that is written, designed or composed by someone else
     * Quotes from textbooks, other sources, or the Internet that are not presented with their sources and are not clearly marked as quotations (plagiarism)
   Ask your professors, Student Service or student advisers at NTNU if you are unsure about the rules relating to cheating. It is the student's own responsibility to find out about the rules
   relating to the use of other people's work - plagiarism - which is against Norwegian law (see below). In an examination, each student must find out what examination support material is
   NTNU has acquired a system for plagiarism detection. This system is designed to detect plagiarism in examination answer papers submitted in connection with teaching at NTNU. This means that
   texts submitted by students in courses at NTNU can be checked for plagiarism.
   What Norwegian law says about cheating
   The Act of 1 April 2005 relating to Universities and University Colleges Section 4-7, Subsection 1, b. states that the University Appeals Committee can annul an examination or test or approval
   of a course if the student has
   attempted to cheat or on purpose or with gross negligence has cheated in the course of or prior to the final assessment of the examination or test concerned, or while taking the course in
   Annulment of the examination (The above Law, Section 4-7, Subsection 1, b)
   The least severe reaction is annulment of the examination. Annulment alone is used in the least serious cases of cheating. An attempt to cheat includes gross negligence. The matter is decided
   by the University Appeals Committee.
   In the graver cases of cheating the student may be excluded from NTNU and may lose the right to take examinations at other institutions covered by the Act relating to Universities and
   University Colleges for a period of one year. The matters is decided by the University Appeals Committee and requires two-thirds majority, see Act of 1 April 2005 relating to Universities and
   NTNU's Examination Regulations can be found on http://www.ntnu.no/studier/reglement. See Examination Regulations at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) (pdf).

   If you have a complaint about examinations you've taken, or grades or marks you've received at NTNU, you have to follow an appeal procedure outlined in Norwegian law.
   The following extract from the Act relating to Universities and University Colleges of 1 April 2005 explains some of the central issues:
   (1) Universities and university colleges shall ensure that students' knowledge and skills are tested and assessed in a manner that is impartial and academically sound.
   Assessment shall also safeguard the academic standards of the course of study in question. An external evaluation shall be made of the assessment or assessment arrangements.
   (2) The board shall appoint examiners for examinations, tests, assessments of assignments or other assessments the results of which are entered on the diploma or included in the mark given for
   the course of study in question. When assessing candidates' independent work in higher degree courses, each candidate shall be assessed by at least two examiners, of whom at least one shall be
   (3) The oral parts of examinations and tests shall be public unless regard for the examination or test arrangements indicates otherwise. The board may make exceptions to the rule concerning
   public examinations in particular cases at the request of the examination candidate concerned when particularly weighty reasons so indicate.
   regulations pursuant to the seventh paragraph set a longer time limit when it is not possible to provide the number of qualified examiners required to complete the marking within three weeks.
   The board may itself in a regulation pursuant to the seventh paragraph set a longer time limit for dissertations and similar large written works.
   (5) Re-marking pursuant to sections 5-2 and 5-3 shall be carried out by at least two new examiners, of whom at least one shall be external. Marks may be changed in the appellant's favour and
   disfavour. If the final mark is set on the basis of both a written and an oral test and an appeal against a mark for the written part of the examination is upheld, a new oral test shall be held
   to determine the final mark.
   (6) The mark awarded following an examination, test, assessment of an assignment or other assessment shall either be pass/fail or be based on a graded scale of six marks from A to F, where A to
   E indicate a pass and F indicates a fail.
   (7) The board itself issues regulations governing the taking and arrangement of examinations and tests, including the conditions for resitting an examination or test and for permission to
   retake a practice period, and provisions concerning registration and the conditions for registration for examinations. In the case of courses for which national curriculum regulations have been
   established pursuant to section 3-2, second paragraph, the regulations must be based on any general provisions concerning examinations and assessment contained in the curriculum regulations.
   The board may delegate the issue of supplementary provisions concerning special circumstances relating to particular examinations to a faculty or department.
   (1) A candidate who has taken an examination or test may complain of procedural errors within three weeks of the date when he or she became or should have become aware of the circumstance on
   which the complaint is based. Such complaints are ruled on by the board itself or the institution's appeals committee.
   (2) If an error was committed which may have affected the student's performance or its assessment, the mark shall be rescinded. If the error can be corrected by re-marking the papers submitted,
   they shall be re-marked. Otherwise a new examination or test shall be held with new examiners. The mark awarded in a second assessment pursuant to the present section may be appealed against
   pursuant to the provisions laid down in section 5-3.
   (3) If a request for explanation of or an appeal against a mark has been submitted, the time limit for an appeal pursuant to this section is reckoned from the date when the student receives the
   explanation or when the appeal is finally ruled on.
   (4) If the board or the board's appeals committee finds that formal errors were committed and that this can reasonably be supposed to have affected the performance of one or more candidates or
   the assessment of that performance, the decision may be taken to carry out a new assessment or to hold a new examination or test.
   (1) A student is entitled to an explanation of the marks awarded for his or her performance. At oral examinations or assessments of practical skills, a request for such an explanation must be
   made immediately on notification of the mark. Requests for explanations of other assessments must be submitted within one week after the candidate learns of the mark, but never more than three
   weeks after the announcement of the mark.
   (2) Explanations shall normally be given within two weeks after the candidate requests them. They shall state the general principles on which the assessment was based and explain the assessment
   of the candidate's performance. Explanations may be given orally or in writing at the examiner's discretion.
   (3) If written guidelines for assessments have been issued, they shall be available to students after the marks have been decided.
   (4) A student may appeal in writing against a mark awarded for his or her performance within three weeks of the announcement of the examination results. The performance shall then be
   reassessed. In the event of a request for an explanation of a mark or a complaint of procedural errors in the question-setting, the examination procedure or the assessment procedure, the time
   limit for appeals pursuant to this section is reckoned from the date when the student receives the explanation or when the appeal is finally ruled on. In connection with the use of continuous
   assessment, the institution may decide whether the student shall submit an appeal following the assessment of a separate examination, assignment or other assessment or whether an appeal shall
   be submitted on announcement of the result of assessment of the study programme, discipline, or module.
   (5) Appeals may not be lodged against marks awarded for oral performance and assessment of practical training or the like which, owing to the nature of the test cannot be reviewed. The results

     * Complaint regarding the grade awarded

   17. When does the semester start and when are the exam periods?
   18. I need help with my application or I want to know if I have a chance to be accepted to the university! Can you answer specific questions about my application?
   Much of what you need to know is listed in the frequently asked questions on this page, or on our Studies webpages. There are separate pages for visiting or exchange students, students who wish
   to pursue a bachelor's or master's degree here, or for potential PhD candidates. If you don't find the information you're looking for, the Office of International Relations is the contact point
   for all international students. PhD candidates and international researchers can contact International Staff Services.
   There are currently no organized campus tours for non-Norwegian students.
   There are no tuition fees at NTNU. There are also a very limited number of scholarships available to help with living expenses and other costs.
   The Norwegian immigration authorities will not issue a student residence permit without proof that you have the funds needed to live here. For the 2012-2013 academic year, the minimum amount
   that you must document for the authorities is NOK 92,500 (approximately        US$ 16,000).
   4. What are the costs of living like in Trondheim and Norway??
   There is a one word answer to this: expensive! But to be more specific, you should probably budget about NOK 9,200 per month to cover your basic costs, such as housing, food and other
   university expenses. In fact, this is why the Norwegian government requires students to demonstrate that they have funds of NOK 92,500 (in 2012-2013) before a student residence permit is
   issued. Your single biggest expense will be housing, which is typically between NOK 4000 and NOK 4500, or more, depending upon whether  you live in a little room or something a little larger.
   Many students rent a "hybel", which is a bed-sit (UK English) or a studio apartment (American English). This is often a room in someone's home, typically in the basement (but with windows) and
   Food is also very expensive, since most of it must come from outside of Norway. But since there are no tuition expenses in Norway, you have to look at the overall costs of your education in
   5. Can I get an undergraduate degree at NTNU if I don't speak Norwegian?
   In a word, no. Nearly all undergraduate level classes are instructed in Norwegian. But if you really want to earn your undergraduate degree here, you can take Norwegian classes at NTNU that
   6. Do I have to speak Norwegian to get a master's or PhD degree at NTNU?
   No. NTNU offers a range of international master's programmes and PhD programmes in English. But you will have to demonstrate that you are proficient in English if you come from a country where
   English is not a native language.
   7. What are the application deadlines?
   The application deadline varies depending on the programme:
     * Exchange students : May 1 for the autumn semester, October 1 for the spring semester.
     * IFUS applicants: December 1 of the year before you intend to start your studies.
     * International master's programmes: December 1 of the year before you intend to start your studies. Final application deadline: February 1.
     * Applicants with a Norwegian or Nordic Degree have a deadline of April 15.
     * Ordinary undergraduate degree programmes taught in Norwegian: Application to the Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service (NUCAS) by March 1 of the same year that you intend to
     * PhD programmes: The deadlines vary depending upon the individual vacancies, but are typically early in the year for a programme beginning in the autumn.
   8. What do I do if I want to study at NTNU as an exchange student?
   If you want to become an exchange student at NTNU, you have to fill in the application form on our website. The application deadline is May 1 for the autumn semester, and October 1 for the
   spring semester. After you have filled in the form and sent it electronically, you must print it, sign it and send it to us in the post with your transcripts. You can also browse a complete
   9. What do I do if I want to study at NTNU as an undergraduate student?
   First, you have to learn Norwegian if it's not your native language -- it's one of the primary admissions requirements. Note that native speakers of Finnish, Swedish and Danish do not have to
   meet the Norwegian language requirement. We offer a one-year full-time course in Norwegian called IFUS for students who would like to study at NTNU but don't know the language. The course
   starts in August every year, but the application deadline is December 1 of the year before you intend to start your studies. After you have passed the Norwegian course, you may continue to
   If you can document your knowledge of Norwegian, you should apply through the Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service (NUCAS). The application deadline for applicants with a
   foreign educational background is March 1 of the same year you intend to start your studies.
   10. What do I do if I want to study at NTNU as a master's student?
   NTNU currently offers more 30 international master's programmes. These programmes are open to applicants who have a bachelor's degree or equivalent in an academic area that is relevant to the
   programme they wish to pursue at NTNU. If you are either employed or a student at one of NTNU's collaborating institutions in Africa, Asia, the Palestinian Areas or Central- and Eastern Europe,
   you may be eligible for a loan and scholarship through the Quota Scheme.
   The Norwegian Agency for International Cooperation and Development also may be a source of funding through the NOMA programme. All master's programmes start in August, and there is no admission
   for the spring semester. For both Quota Scheme applicants and applicants with individual funding, the preliminary application deadline is December 1, with the final application deadline of
   11. What do I do if I want to study at NTNU as a PhD student?
   If you intend to come to NTNU as a PhD candidate, you are advised to contact the relevant Faculty directly. Please see our website on or a list of all faculties and departments at NTNU. You
   vacancy, you'll want to adhere to the deadlines in the description.
   12. Do you offer Norwegian courses?
   We do. We have an intensive summer course that lasts for 3-4 weeks, courses that run for the whole semester (you have to pass three semesters to meet NTNU's language requirements) and a
   year-long intensive Norwegian course that upon successful completion meets NTNU's Norwegian requirements. The intensive summer course is mainly intended for exchange students or master's or PhD
   students who are coming to NTNU in the autumn semester and need to learn some Norwegian first, whereas the semester course is intended for students/ employees at NTNU who are staying in Norway
   for some time.Everyone with a residence permit in Norway may apply for this course, however, and some places are reserved for applicants that are not connected to NTNU.

   Much of what you need to know is listed in the frequently asked questions on this page, or on our Studies webpages. There are separate pages for visiting or exchange students, students who wish
   to pursue a bachelor's or master's degree here, or for potential PhD candidates. If you don't find the information you're looking for, the Office of International Relations is the contact point
   for all international students. PhD candidates and international researchers can contact International Staff Services.
   There are currently no organized campus tours for non-Norwegian students.
   There are no tuition fees at NTNU. There are also a very limited number of scholarships available to help with living expenses and other costs.
   The Norwegian immigration authorities will not issue a student residence permit without proof that you have the funds needed to live here. For the 2012-2013 academic year, the minimum amount
   that you must document for the authorities is NOK 92,500 (approximately        US$ 16,000).
   4. What are the costs of living like in Trondheim and Norway??
   There is a one word answer to this: expensive! But to be more specific, you should probably budget about NOK 9,200 per month to cover your basic costs, such as housing, food and other
   university expenses. In fact, this is why the Norwegian government requires students to demonstrate that they have funds of NOK 92,500 (in 2012-2013) before a student residence permit is
   issued. Your single biggest expense will be housing, which is typically between NOK 4000 and NOK 4500, or more, depending upon whether  you live in a little room or something a little larger.
   Many students rent a "hybel", which is a bed-sit (UK English) or a studio apartment (American English). This is often a room in someone's home, typically in the basement (but with windows) and
   Food is also very expensive, since most of it must come from outside of Norway. But since there are no tuition expenses in Norway, you have to look at the overall costs of your education in
   5. Can I get an undergraduate degree at NTNU if I don't speak Norwegian?
   In a word, no. Nearly all undergraduate level classes are instructed in Norwegian. But if you really want to earn your undergraduate degree here, you can take Norwegian classes at NTNU that
   6. Do I have to speak Norwegian to get a master's or PhD degree at NTNU?
   No. NTNU offers a range of international master's programmes and PhD programmes in English. But you will have to demonstrate that you are proficient in English if you come from a country where
   English is not a native language.
   7. What are the application deadlines?
   The application deadline varies depending on the programme:
     * Exchange students : May 1 for the autumn semester, October 1 for the spring semester.
     * IFUS applicants: December 1 of the year before you intend to start your studies.

   First, you have to learn Norwegian if it's not your native language -- it's one of the primary admissions requirements. Note that native speakers of Finnish, Swedish and Danish do not have to
   meet the Norwegian language requirement. We offer a one-year full-time course in Norwegian called IFUS for students who would like to study at NTNU but don't know the language. The course
   starts in August every year, but the application deadline is December 1 of the year before you intend to start your studies. After you have passed the Norwegian course, you may continue to
   If you can document your knowledge of Norwegian, you should apply through the Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service (NUCAS). The application deadline for applicants with a

   10. What do I do if I want to study at NTNU as a master's student?
   NTNU currently offers more 30 international master's programmes. These programmes are open to applicants who have a bachelor's degree or equivalent in an academic area that is relevant to the
   programme they wish to pursue at NTNU. If you are either employed or a student at one of NTNU's collaborating institutions in Africa, Asia, the Palestinian Areas or Central- and Eastern Europe,
   you may be eligible for a loan and scholarship through the Quota Scheme.
   The Norwegian Agency for International Cooperation and Development also may be a source of funding through the NOMA programme. All master's programmes start in August, and there is no admission
   for the spring semester. For both Quota Scheme applicants and applicants with individual funding, the preliminary application deadline is December 1, with the final application deadline of

   12. Do you offer Norwegian courses?
   We do. We have an intensive summer course that lasts for 3-4 weeks, courses that run for the whole semester (you have to pass three semesters to meet NTNU's language requirements) and a
   year-long intensive Norwegian course that upon successful completion meets NTNU's Norwegian requirements. The intensive summer course is mainly intended for exchange students or master's or PhD
   students who are coming to NTNU in the autumn semester and need to learn some Norwegian first, whereas the semester course is intended for students/ employees at NTNU who are staying in Norway
   for some time.Everyone with a residence permit in Norway may apply for this course, however, and some places are reserved for applicants that are not connected to NTNU.

       all educational institutions affected by the Norwegian Universities' Act for a maximum of one year (Norwegian Universities' Act, Section 42, subsection 3). This type of reaction requires
       evidence that the student either intended to commit an examination offence or plagiarize or is guilty of gross negligence. Students who are found guilty of academic misconduct or plagiarism
       are deprived of all their rights as students for the duration of the penalty. This includes denied access to all teaching and instruction, computer laboratories and reading rooms, blocking
       of admission cards and they will not receive either a bank giro to pay their tuition fees or a semester card.
    1. In connection with home examinations and term papers any suspicion of plagiarism usually first arises with the external examiner or the subject teacher. The Department refers cases on
       suspected plagiarism to the Faculty. On suspicion of academic misconduct in examinations in the examination room, the invigilators will report to the Examination Office. These cases are
       usually not brought to the Department/Faculty. The remaining procedure is identical to that of other cases of suspected academic misconduct or plagiarism.

       There are also two academic staff members and two students on the Board. In cases of academic misconduct/attempted academic misconduct the Complaints Board can annul the evaluation
       (Norwegian Universities' Act, Section 54). Further more, the Board can exclude a student that has commited an examination offence/attempted to commit academic misconduct for up to one year.

   In a meeting on 20 June 2005 the Heads of Department adopted the Faculty of Humanities' (formerly: the Faculty of Arts) plan against academic misconduct/plagiarism. The plan is an intergrated
   part of the Faculty's action plan as well as the Quality Assurance System.
   As part of this plan, instructions for the Departments have been prepared relating to the difference between academic misconduct/plagiarism and occurrences of assignments/papers that fall below
   One of the main objectives of this work is to develop a common practice when treating various types of poor scholarship to the extent possible considering the several different forms of
   During the entire process of developing a plan to reduce the occurrence of plagiarism and academic misconduct, emphasis has been placed on increasing the students' ethical consciousness
   have good routines for procedures in cases that do not classify as academic misconduct but fail to meet the requirements for academic work.
   It is important to clarify what the laws and regulations define as academic misconduct, and is treated as cases of such. Being found guilty of academic misconduct will have serious consequences
   for the student involved. For this reason, strict requirements apply as to what can be defined as academic misconduct.
   Today, academic misconduct is to a large extent related to plagiarism or the use of sources without reference particularly when using the Internet. New methods of assessment also involve other
   types of activities, but we have chosen to focus on written assignments/tests, including the final written examination and larger written compulsory assignments.
   According to Act relating to Universities and Colleges (hereafter abbreviated Norwegian Universities' Act), only assignments/tests/exercises that count for the final grade and larger compulsory
   assignments can be subject to cases of academic misconduct. The Faculty of Arts has not given a definition of `larger compulsory assignments', but we have established a practice that defines
   papers of more than 8 to 10 pages as `large' in this connection. However, this rule is neither absolute nor normative. It is regarded as a guideline, and opens for the possibility of smaller
   such activity in the course, if at Master's level, and if the assignment includes major academic challenges.
   With a gradual transition, our scale ranges from obvious academic misconduct according to the law via poor scholarship to poor performance. Academic misconduct according to the Norwegian
   Universities' Act requires evidence that the student either wilfully used unauthorized items or texts or plagiarized other people's texts in order to obtain a higher grade, or committed such an
   Cases of academic misconduct are treated according to the adopted guidelines and are eventually discussed in NTNU's Appeals Committee. Norwegian Universities' Act, Section 42 subsection 3, and
   Section 54 subsections 1a and 1b, and Study regulations at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Section 36 (Norwegian only)
   Criteria for evaluation of sanctions for cases that do not classify as academic misconduct
   Assignments/papers and other activities which need to be approved (not graded) before the student can sit his or her exams.
   Compulsory assignments (both written and oral) that do not count for the final grade are generally treated differently from activities that are graded. Compulsory assignments are part of the
   continuous assessment which is part of the student's learning environment. Hence, the objective is not as much to test the students' knowledge and skills as to provide learning and guidance.
   Please note that only larger compulsory assignments fall under the regulations governing academic misconduct even in cases of serious neglect.
   Semester assignments/semester papers/term papers, take-home examinations and other activities that are graded and count in the final course assessment.
   Assignments that count in the final course evaluation are usually dealt with more seriously than compulsory assignments, but considerations may be made to the course level, the size of the
   assignment and how much it counts for the final grade.
   Please note that when it comes to activities that count in the final course evaluation, careful considerations must be made as to whether the neglect is so serious that it classifies as
   It is natural to react milder to occurrences of papers failing to meet minimal standards of documentation and independent work for students in the initial stage of their Bachelor's degree
   programme (basic level) than for students at Master's level. Occurrences of papers falling below a minimal standard of academic acceptability will also be dealt with differently if it is
   submitted at an early stage (basic level) of a major/specialization than at a later stage (intermediate level) of the same study. Later in a Bachelor's degree programme (e.g. at the
   intermediate level of the student's first or second major/specialization) it will not be natural to differentiate between students at the basic and intermediate levels. Requirements set for
   This is a matter of opinion. When it comes to plagiarism in examination papers, large parts of the paper must be a direct copy before the student is found guilty of committing an examination
   offence/academic misconduct. Attempts have been made to create tables where the percentage of plagiarized text is evaluated to reactions and sanctions. However, this approach very easily
   becomes too rigid, as considerations are not made for differences between subjects, levels and form of assessment. We rather ought to develop a common understanding of where to put the line
   When evaluating the degree of neglect, another aspect which needs consideration is the degree of guidance and information the student has been offered regarding academic writing, including
   The first element to consider is whether or not the case in question fulfils the Norwegian Universities' Act's requirements for academic misconduct:
   The assignment/test counts in the final assessment of the course (graded activity), or is a larger compulsory assignment.
   In cases of academic misconduct, NTNU's Appeals Committee decides upon the reaction based on prevailing regulations (The Norwegian Universities' Act, Section 4, subsections 7 and 8, and Study
   regulations at NTNU and Instructive guidelines for the management of academic misconduct/attempted academic misconduct at NTNU)
   Activities counting for the final grade
   Regarding graded assignments, unacceptable standards of scholarship will be discovered by the examiner during the marking process. Assignments lacking documentation/references/bibliography may
   result in a lower grade; plagiarism (not to the extent that it classifies as academic misconduct) may result in a fail grade for failing to meet minimal standards of independent work. The
   academic environments take the level of study into account in these matters.
   Example of a potential problem:
   Is it reasonable to react milder to a smaller semester assignment of minor importance for the final grade and/or submitted at an early stage of the Bachelor's programme than to a home
   examination submitted late in the programme?
   Compulsory assignments that do not count for the final grade
   For compulsory assignments/assignments that do not count for the final grade, the situation is different. As already mentioned, the compulsory assignments are part of the continuous assessment
   which is part of the students learning environment. The main objective of these activities/assignments is not to test the students' knowledge and skills, but to provide learning and guidance.
   The reaction in this case may vary depending on the course level of the assignment, whether the assignment is one of several smaller assignments, and whether the student previously has been
   made aware of poor references in his or her papers. Hence, it is not obvious that a paper submitted at an early stage of the programme where the student quite clearly has copied a source
   without providing any reference will result in the student losing his/her right to sit the exam. It will be more suitable for the purpose to offer advice and give the student the opportunity to
   submit the paper once more. If this is one of several smaller assignments, it may be approved followed by advice and comments as to what must be improved before submitting the next paper.
   We have provided a checklist of different factors that should/ought to be taken into account when considering cases of academic misconduct or papers failing to meet standards of documentation
   We would also like to point out that this is not meant to be rigid instructions, but rather guidelines for academic environments and departments in order to develop the most appropriate
   routines and procedures. Discussions related to this topic will be an important part of the work of a contact group. The contact group consists of the deputy heads, as well as one
   administrative member of staff from each department, which was established in the autumn semester of 2005 which gathers the persons in charge of this work from each department.
   The categories are not absolute. The academic environments are free to evaluate the division between assignments/tests that count to a higher or smaller degree for the final grade. There may be
   cases where a strict reaction is appropriate even though the assignment/test is of minor importance and vice versa. The line between more or less than 50 per cent is put to indicate that it may
   be useful to differentiate between important and less important activities as regarding the final course evaluation.
   Each activity may be checked off more than once. It may for instance be important to check whether an assignment is a piece of individual work or a group assignment (working method), regardless
     * Graded assignment that amounts to less than 50 per cent of the final grade evaluation basis for the course/subject
     * Graded assignment that amounts to more than 50 per cent of the final grade evaluation basis for the course/subject
   In addition to the type of activity, the working method bears consequences for the reaction. Raising the students' consciousness related to what is expected from an individual paper versus
   group work is important. The students would like the academic environments to offer more courses in writing at all levels. Alternatively, lectures or group sessions at the Introductory level
   (Ex. Phil.) could be used to a higher degree as a writing course, where the students also will have an introduction to the requirements for a good academic paper presented by their own academic
   environment, and a follow-up throughout the programme.
   Here it will be appropriate to differentiate between the basic level and the intermediate level within the same subject specialization.
     * Early in the Introductory level (Ex. Phil./Ex. Fac.)
     * Later in the Introductory level (Ex. Phil./Ex. Fac.)
     * Early in the Bachelor's programme/basic level
     * Early in the Bachelor's programme/intermediate level
     * Late in the Bachelor's programme/second subject specialization/one-year study programme
   Degree of the offence
   It is also appropriate to differentiate the degree of the offence:
     * Was the student offered the necessary/adequate tuition in and information about the use of sources, references and other rules and standards for academic writing?
   The sanctions will be evaluated in relation to the type of activity, the course level and the degree of the offence.
     * The student is called to a meeting and given the opportunity to submit a new assignment *)
   *) The departments need to decide to what extent they would prefer routines for submission of new assignments, including the number of new chances and deadlines. We do not recommend that
   students may sit their exams provided that they submit obligatory assignments after the examination; such cases require the students to give their written consent to their sitting their exams
   with reservations to the compulsory assignments being approved.
   Examples of how to make use of the checklist
   If the following items are checked off
     * Submitted early in the Bachelor's programme at the basic level
   The case does not fall under the regulations governing academic misconduct (not a graded activity, not large enough compulsory assignment).
   The student is called to a meeting and given the opportunity to submit a new assignment.
   If the following items are checked off
     * Submitted early in the Bachelor's programme at basic level (usually the first and second semesters)
   The case falls under the regulations governing academic misconduct (large compulsory assignment and serious offence).
   Note: If the extent of the plagiarism is not large enough to classify as academic misconduct, or if other circumstances relating to the assignment makes a report about academic misconduct out
   of the question: The student is called to a meeting and given the opportunity to submit a new assignment. Alternatively, the assignment is awarded a fail grade, particularly if the student has
   If the following items are checked off
     * Submitted late in the Bachelor's programme (e.g. at specialization level)
   The case does not fall under the regulations governing academic misconduct (not graded activity, not serious enough offence).
   If this is the first of several minor assignments and the assignment otherwise is good, the academic environment may choose to approve the assignment after a meeting with the student. If the
   next compulsory assignment also is characterized by plagiarism, there is good cause to award a fail grade.
   If the following items are checked off
     * Graded assignment that amounts to less than 50 per cent of the final evaluation basis for the course/subject
     * Submitted early in the Bachelor's programme at basic level
   The case falls under the regulations governing academic misconduct (graded activity, serious offence).
   If the assignment is of minor importance to the final grade, considerations may be made to the early stage of the programme, particularly if the information about or training in the use of
   sources and academic work has been poor, and the result may be lower grade.
   If the following items are checked off
     * graded assignment that amounts to more than 50 per cent of the final evaluation basis for the course/subject
     * submitted early in the Bachelor's programme at basic level
   The case does not fall under the regulations governing academic misconduct (not serious enough offence).
   Low grade or fail grade. The later in the programme the assignment is submitted, the better reason to award a fail grade.
   Note: In cases where a low grade is the result of plagiarism/unacceptable academic standard, where an assignment fails to meet minimal standards of documentation and/or independent work, it is
   necessary to state this information in the argumentation for the grade.
   If the following items are checked off
     * Graded assignment that amounts to more than 50 per cent of the final evaluation for the course/subject
     * Submitted early in the Bachelor's programme at basic level
   The case falls under the regulations governing academic misconduct (graded activity, serious offence).

   which is part of the students learning environment. The main objective of these activities/assignments is not to test the students' knowledge and skills, but to provide learning and guidance.
   The reaction in this case may vary depending on the course level of the assignment, whether the assignment is one of several smaller assignments, and whether the student previously has been
   made aware of poor references in his or her papers. Hence, it is not obvious that a paper submitted at an early stage of the programme where the student quite clearly has copied a source
   without providing any reference will result in the student losing his/her right to sit the exam. It will be more suitable for the purpose to offer advice and give the student the opportunity to
   submit the paper once more. If this is one of several smaller assignments, it may be approved followed by advice and comments as to what must be improved before submitting the next paper.
   We have provided a checklist of different factors that should/ought to be taken into account when considering cases of academic misconduct or papers failing to meet standards of documentation
   We would also like to point out that this is not meant to be rigid instructions, but rather guidelines for academic environments and departments in order to develop the most appropriate
   routines and procedures. Discussions related to this topic will be an important part of the work of a contact group. The contact group consists of the deputy heads, as well as one
   administrative member of staff from each department, which was established in the autumn semester of 2005 which gathers the persons in charge of this work from each department.
   The categories are not absolute. The academic environments are free to evaluate the division between assignments/tests that count to a higher or smaller degree for the final grade. There may be
   cases where a strict reaction is appropriate even though the assignment/test is of minor importance and vice versa. The line between more or less than 50 per cent is put to indicate that it may
   be useful to differentiate between important and less important activities as regarding the final course evaluation.
   Each activity may be checked off more than once. It may for instance be important to check whether an assignment is a piece of individual work or a group assignment (working method), regardless
     * Graded assignment that amounts to less than 50 per cent of the final grade evaluation basis for the course/subject
     * Graded assignment that amounts to more than 50 per cent of the final grade evaluation basis for the course/subject
   In addition to the type of activity, the working method bears consequences for the reaction. Raising the students' consciousness related to what is expected from an individual paper versus
   group work is important. The students would like the academic environments to offer more courses in writing at all levels. Alternatively, lectures or group sessions at the Introductory level
   (Ex. Phil.) could be used to a higher degree as a writing course, where the students also will have an introduction to the requirements for a good academic paper presented by their own academic
   environment, and a follow-up throughout the programme.
   Here it will be appropriate to differentiate between the basic level and the intermediate level within the same subject specialization.
     * Early in the Introductory level (Ex. Phil./Ex. Fac.)
     * Later in the Introductory level (Ex. Phil./Ex. Fac.)
     * Early in the Bachelor's programme/basic level
     * Early in the Bachelor's programme/intermediate level
     * Late in the Bachelor's programme/second subject specialization/one-year study programme
   Degree of the offence
   It is also appropriate to differentiate the degree of the offence:
     * Was the student offered the necessary/adequate tuition in and information about the use of sources, references and other rules and standards for academic writing?
   The sanctions will be evaluated in relation to the type of activity, the course level and the degree of the offence.
     * The student is called to a meeting and given the opportunity to submit a new assignment *)
   *) The departments need to decide to what extent they would prefer routines for submission of new assignments, including the number of new chances and deadlines. We do not recommend that
   students may sit their exams provided that they submit obligatory assignments after the examination; such cases require the students to give their written consent to their sitting their exams
   with reservations to the compulsory assignments being approved.
   Examples of how to make use of the checklist
   If the following items are checked off
     * Submitted early in the Bachelor's programme at the basic level
   The case does not fall under the regulations governing academic misconduct (not a graded activity, not large enough compulsory assignment).
   The student is called to a meeting and given the opportunity to submit a new assignment.
   If the following items are checked off
     * Submitted early in the Bachelor's programme at basic level (usually the first and second semesters)
   The case falls under the regulations governing academic misconduct (large compulsory assignment and serious offence).
   Note: If the extent of the plagiarism is not large enough to classify as academic misconduct, or if other circumstances relating to the assignment makes a report about academic misconduct out
   of the question: The student is called to a meeting and given the opportunity to submit a new assignment. Alternatively, the assignment is awarded a fail grade, particularly if the student has
   If the following items are checked off
     * Submitted late in the Bachelor's programme (e.g. at specialization level)
   The case does not fall under the regulations governing academic misconduct (not graded activity, not serious enough offence).
   If this is the first of several minor assignments and the assignment otherwise is good, the academic environment may choose to approve the assignment after a meeting with the student. If the
   next compulsory assignment also is characterized by plagiarism, there is good cause to award a fail grade.
   If the following items are checked off
     * Graded assignment that amounts to less than 50 per cent of the final evaluation basis for the course/subject
     * Submitted early in the Bachelor's programme at basic level
   The case falls under the regulations governing academic misconduct (graded activity, serious offence).
   If the assignment is of minor importance to the final grade, considerations may be made to the early stage of the programme, particularly if the information about or training in the use of
   sources and academic work has been poor, and the result may be lower grade.
   If the following items are checked off
     * graded assignment that amounts to more than 50 per cent of the final evaluation basis for the course/subject
     * submitted early in the Bachelor's programme at basic level
   The case does not fall under the regulations governing academic misconduct (not serious enough offence).
   Low grade or fail grade. The later in the programme the assignment is submitted, the better reason to award a fail grade.
   Note: In cases where a low grade is the result of plagiarism/unacceptable academic standard, where an assignment fails to meet minimal standards of documentation and/or independent work, it is
   necessary to state this information in the argumentation for the grade.
   If the following items are checked off
     * Graded assignment that amounts to more than 50 per cent of the final evaluation for the course/subject
     * Submitted early in the Bachelor's programme at basic level
   The case falls under the regulations governing academic misconduct (graded activity, serious offence).

   Follow the links to read about each programme. Or you may find more information about the PhD education at NTNU here.
   If you have not been admitted to any of the PhD programmes you may still apply for the opportunity to submit a thesis for evaluation for the degree of dr.philos. A Norwegian doctoral degree is
   awarded as proof that the candidate's research qualifications are of a certain standard. The same standards apply for the research qualifications for a dr.philos. degree as for a PhD degree.
   This principle of equivalence refers to the academic standard and quality of the work submitted, not merely its scope. Since the degree of dr. philos. does not include an organized research
   training programme, the preparatory work (e.g. the collection of data) and the thesis itself are expected to be more extensive than that required in degrees with an organized research training

   Guidelines for the Agreement Between Student and Home Department Concerning the Master's Degree - rights and duties
   1. The Master's programme agreement is a part of the student's individual education plan. The agreement is a binding contract regarding co-operation between the student, his/her academic
   supervisor and the Department, and it specifies the rights and duties that acceptance on to the Master's programme carries with it.
   2. Students who are admitted to a Master's programme are obliged to sign their Master's agreement and confirm their electronically based individual education plan by the relevant deadline (15
   September for students admitted in the autumn semester and 15 February for students admitted in the spring semester). A student's right to academic supervision and a personal or shared space in
   the reading rooms at Dragvoll is dependent upon the student having signed the agreement, confirmed his or her individual education plan each semester, and having paid the semester fee.
   3. The student's progression in relation to the nominal length of study must be specified in the agreement, and confirmed in the student's individual education plan. The agreed progression of
   study is based on the nominal length of two years of full-time study (30 ECTS credits per semester/60 ECTS credits per year). However, it is possible to apply for permission to study part time
   (we refer to Study regulations at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, § 8). This means that it is possible to complete the course of study as a part-time student with a maximum
   of four years of study). The time frame is stated in the Master's programme agreement and in the individual education plan. Students who fail to complete their course of study within this time
   frame without valid reason (valid reasons include illness and approved leave of absence) will have their place in the Master's programme withdrawn (see Study regulations at the Norwegian
   4. Students are obliged to demonstrate progression in relation to the nominal length of study, unless they have been granted the right to study part-time. Leave of absence and part-time study
   can be approved following an application from the student (we refer to Study regulations at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, § 7). A student wishing to make such an
   5. Students are entitled to a total of 80 hours of academic supervision during their work with a Master's thesis that counts 60 credits. If the thesis counts fewer than 60 credits the number of
   hours allocated to academic supervision will be reduced according to the number of credits awarded for the thesis. The number of hours allocated to academic supervision is not related to
   whether or not the student completes the Master's programme within the nominal period of study. The time frame includes individual supervision as well as preparatory - and supplementary work
   for the supervisor. The estimated ratio for individual supervision vs. preparatory - and supplementary work is 1:4.
   6. During the course of the academic supervision of the Master's thesis the supervisor is specifically responsible for:
     * giving advice regarding framing and delimitation of the topic and approach to the problem
     * ensuring that s/he is updated on the student's progress vis-a-vis the appointed time frame and progress schedule.
     * providing the student with information about ethical guidelines in relation to the work on the Master's thesis.
   7. If the academic supervisor is absent for a longer period of time as a result of research leave, illness or travel, the Department is responsible for appointing a new supervisor on the
   8. The student is responsible for allotting time for supervision within the time frame of the Master's agreement.
   9. The student is obliged to keep the academic supervisor and the Department updated on his or her academic progress. If s/he for some reason is forced to discontinue the course of study for a
   period of one semester or longer, this must be agreed and approved by the Department in advance. Part-time studies and leave of absence must be noted on the agreement form if applicable.
   10. If relations between the student and the supervisor become problematic for either the student or the supervisor, one or both of the parties may ask to be released from the academic
   supervision agreement. The Department is obliged to appoint a new supervisor if such a request is made.
   11. The Master's programme agreement must be monitored each semester in order to ensure that any required adjustments and changes to the agreement are made.
   12. In cases where the student submits a new thesis (if the primary thesis is not given a pass grade, see Study regulations at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, § 31), the
   student is obliged to enter into a new agreement with the Department, and this must be based on those changes and improvements to the thesis that are planned and approved.

   Bokforside When the British Labour party announced the withdrawal of British forces from the Persian Gulf in January 1968, the United States faced a potential power vacuum in the area. The
   incoming Nixon administration, preoccupied with the Soviet Union and China, and the war in Vietnam, had no intention of replacing the British in the Gulf. To avoid further military commitments,
   the US encouraged Iran and Saudi Arabia to maintain area security. A critical policy decision, overlooked by most scholars, saw Nixon and Kissinger engineer the rise in oil prices between 1969
   and 1972 to enable Saudi Arabia and Iran to purchase the necessary military hardware to serve as guardians of the Gulf. For all their bluster about reversing Labour's withdrawal decision, after
   their surprise victory in the election of June 1970 the Conservatives adhered to Labour's policy. But in contrast to Labour's wish to cut the umbilical cord of empire, the Tories wanted to
   retain influence in the Persian Gulf, pursuing policies largely independent of the US by the creation of the United Arab Emirates, deposing the sultan of Oman, and trying to solve the dispute
   over the Buraimi oasis with Saudi Arabia. By trying to maintain its empire on the cheap, Britain turned into an arms supplier supreme. But offering and selling arms does not make a foreign
   policy, leaving Britain in the long run with less influence in regional affairs. This was true also for the US, whose arms sales were to prove no realistic an alternative to foreign policy.The
   US hid under the Iranian security blanket for almost a decade. Given the weakness of the regime and the Shah's nonsensical dreams of turning Iran into one of the top five industrial and

   Bokforside When the British Labour party announced the withdrawal of British forces from the Persian Gulf in January 1968, the United States faced a potential power vacuum in the area. The
   incoming Nixon administration, preoccupied with the Soviet Union and China, and the war in Vietnam, had no intention of replacing the British in the Gulf. To avoid further military commitments,
   the US encouraged Iran and Saudi Arabia to maintain area security. A critical policy decision, overlooked by most scholars, saw Nixon and Kissinger engineer the rise in oil prices between 1969

   Language and Communication Studies (ISK), the discipline of Theoretical Linguistics is now a very active and internationally oriented field also in the Department of Scandinavian Studies and
   Comparative Literature (INL) and the Department of Modern Foreign Languages (IFS).
   In General Phonetics, the phonetics group at ISK has a unique position being the only place in Norway that has phonetic research and teaching as its prime institutional responsibility, and the
   ISK phoneticians contribute to theoretical and applied research (e.g. speech synthesis and speech recognition), with a wide circle of cooperation partners locally (both in their own Faculty and
   Minimalism), which is exceptional on a world basis, and in research networks, spanning not only networks devoted to the study of Scandinavian languages and their dialects, but also, in Europe
   the other Germanic languages (English and German) and the Balkan and South Slavic area, and in Asia especially East and South Asian languages (Mandarin Chinese, the languages of India), and in
   Africa all of the three main linguistic areas Bantu, Ethio-Semitic and West-African. Furthermore, the linguistic effects of globalization, as witnessed in accelerating phenomena of language
   contact and language change in many parts of the globe, have become thriving fields of research in all three departments, especially as it relates to first, second, and third language
   acquisition, but research on linguistic identity and on minority and majority languages is also in vogue. Experimental methods are widely used, for instance in the Phonetics Lab at ISK and in
   the Language Acquisition and Language Processing Lab at IFS.
   As linguistic theory and formalism consolidated throughout the 70s and 80s, giving rise to the development of computational tools and applications, linguists at ISK performed a development of
   computational lexical resources during the late 80s and 90s which is still outstanding internationally, and from early 2000 these resources have become supplemented by state of the art
   grammatical and semantic analysis tools. Digital documentation of language resources has correspondingly been a key activity, where the groups at NTNU, apart from the documentation of
   Norwegian, have also been involved in documentation of Old Slavic and of six African languages. In particular, one may mention the breaking of new empirical and theoretical ground in
   dialectology through the investigation and documentation of Norwegian and Scandinavian dialect syntax done at INL. This work is done in collaboration with several other universities in the
   Nordic countries, through the Nordic Center of Excellence of Microcomparative Syntax (NORMS), and through the ScanDiaSyn and NorDiaSyn networks/projects.
   Theoretically sustained research on language acquisition and language development are thriving new fields in all three departments. At ISK, this research is primarily done in the phonetics
   group and in applied linguistics. IFS and INL collaborate on various subprojects centering on the comparative and acquisitional study of Mandarin Chinese, English, and Norwegian. Also, in the
   children and second language acquisition with adults) as well as on language processing (for instance comprehension and categorisation) is done with the aim of finding out how humans develop
   their abilities to understand and reflect on the world around them and to talk about it.
   A common denominator of the theoretical approaches both in linguistics and phonetics and the computational developments is the idea of genericity: In theoretical linguistic research, a key
   assumption is that human languages are largely based on a common design. This assumption is fundamental for the comparative theoretical and empirical research being done at INL and IFS, seeking
   to develop e.g. Scandinavian and English linguistics as research disciplines beyond their traditional limits of descriptive one-language focus. In language technology, the corresponding
   assumption is bi-pronged: (1) when building computational applications involving language, the linguistic systems should be the same whether the application is ma¬chine translation, text
   summary, grammar checking, robot navigation, etc.; (2) reflecting the theoretical genericity assumption, in language technology, multilingual shared design and reusability of resources are key
   desiderata. Through the combined ongoing efforts of the theoretical, acquisitional and computational groups, the groups are constructing genericity-based designs and products that aim beyond
   the current state of the art, with a basis in soundly used existing analytic and computational practice.

   Performativityis a new interdisciplinary focus area at the Faculty of Humanities created to research the role of performativity in contemporary art, communication and knowledge formation.
   Through this research we aim to expand and challenge our understanding of the performative - of active intervention - in these fields. This focus area promotes interdisciplinarity, which

About the project
   Performativity is an interdisciplinary focus area at the Faculty of Humanities created to research the role of performativity in contemporary art, communication and knowledge formation. Through
   this research we aim to expand and challenge our understanding of the performative - of active intervention - in these fields. This focus area promotes interdisciplinarity, which consists on
   the meeting of practical work and theoretical reflexion.
   We find the performative as «high tech» artistic practices that challenge established understandings of technology as purely instrumental and which even enter the realm of science by framing
   their projects as experiments. There is a clear focus on intervention and creativity within 'performance' and various forms of virtuality and games. Performativity as concept and as perspective
   challenges today established visions of knowledge formation and established understandings of the relationship between theory and practice, between scene and venue, between art and science.
   Performativity may denote specific traits of various forms of expression, but also deal with a particular perspective in all communication. In the former case performativity deals with, for
   instance, words that create what they name. Furthermore it deals with stagings, rituals and musical expression where what is created in the moment is prioritized over reenactment and
   representation. Understood as a more general perspective, performativity deals with bringing out the creative, constitutive and active in every concept and every expression. In this way
   performativity as perspective also deals with understanding staging as a basic condition for what it is to continuously be constituted as a subject.
   The creation of this focus area is an attempt from the Faculty of Humanities to 'make use of the potential for collaborative research across the boundaries of institutes and disciplines at the
   Faculty of Humanities to develop disciplinary quality, stimulate larger research projects and contribute to create a profile of the faculty, institutes and disciplinary environment'. The
   Faculty's concrete objectives are, among others, increasing academic publishing in relevant networks and the formation of research projects for applying to external research funding
   institutions on national and international levels. The priority of the performativity research area is to stimulate projects with new methodologies that address the intersection between

   The Tower Block is the main building in the old central hospital in Trondheim. Now it is demolished as a new modern hospital is rising on its grounds. As a way of drawing attention to the
   disappearance of an emotional landmark in the city, we have created a project that explores the connection of the Tower block and the city of Trondheim, focusing on the memories that the site
   has generated in the people over time.
     * First we have created a webpage that allows people gathering memories from the Tower block. At the web page www.hoyblokka.no the memories are presented as light in the windows of the Tower
       block. Some memories are written, some are told, and some are presented in various experimental ways, using the concepts of soundscapes, landscapes and handscapes.
     * These memories are the basis for the second stage, a memorial service for the Tower block held in january 2011. In the ruins of the Tower blokc, under its concrete skeleton a performance in
       the form of a multimedia ritual where light, sound and video projection called the Tower block to life for the last time.
     * Third, the Tower Block is a research project that explores the relations between art and research. We focus on topics such as the performative aspects of memories; the role of writing and
       technology in the manifestation of memory; the nature of place and emptiness in wakening the presence of things long gone; the relationship between emptyness and technology; and what can we

Picturing the Brain
   Neuroimaging enjoys an increasing prominence, not only among medical doctors, neuroscientists and philosophers, but in society at large. Brain images are deeply compelling, and are claimed to
   provide windows into the living brain. Yet what these images really show remains a debated issue. The research project Picturing the Brain: Perspectives on Neuroimaging (2010-2013) seeks to
   deepen our understanding of the epistemological roles neuroimaging technologies play in the conduct and communication of medicine and science. The primary objective is, more precisely, to
   develop a fine-grained understanding of socio-cultural and ethical issues that arise in relation to current applications of these technologies, as they are put to use as cognitive tools, as
   perceptual prostheses, and as visual rhetoric. The project is interdisciplinary and allows researchers with backgrounds in media studies, philosophy, digital media engineering, medical imaging,
   neuroscience, and creative arts to work together on specific tasks in varying configurations. The project is funded by the Research Council of Norway.

   Chain Reaction is a hybrid form of pervasive game and interactive theater that investigates the challenges of combining ubiquitous computing and game design with theatre conventions. Perez uses
   game design as part of her research process in order to explore how participatory games can be used to enable alternative ways of engaging with theatre, more specifically how games together
   with new media applications can foster creative participation in artistic practices.
   Chain Reaction experiments with howto make participants engage artistically with others in public spaces, and ultimately create a short piece of theatre as a result of their interaction with
   the city. It was developed from August to October 2009 in the city of Berkeley, California, and orchestrated for the second time in Theaterhouse Avantgarden in Trondheim, Norway, in May 2011.
   explain the game rules and hand in maps and cellphones. In the map there are checkpoints marked. Players must go in groups of two and visit all the checkpoints. In each checkpoint there is an
   actor that delivers a task that players must complete. The tasks are about generating different pieces of artistic material - text, sound, movement and a theatre sculpture - resulting from the
   interaction with the environment. In the last checkpoint, teams re-group and the task is about devising a short piece of performance out of the materials they have collected. Every group
   performs its piece to the rest of participants -other players and the actors - and there is a vote to decide on the best show, who wins a symbolic trophy. Movement task: Participants were asked
   to perform a slow motion movement sequence while listening to music, at Trondheim torg, 2011. (Photo: Ingvild Aarseth)
   (Song mission: Participants were asked to engage in conversation with a stranger and get her to sing her favorite song. This team in Berkeley succeeded after trying for 20 minutes)

   NTNU aims to have a modern research infrastructure as well as a learning and working environment that attracts the most talented students and staff. Trondheim is to have a reputation as the
   We will dare to tackle the most challenging questions in science and to seek innovative solutions. We will educate people who are able to meet the national and global challenges of tomorrow. We
   We will maintain an open and constructive dialogue within the university and with the world around us. We will take social responsibility and influence the development of society through
   We will build on fundamental democratic values and represent an unprejudiced and independent voice. We will challenge conventional ideas and solutions, seek new knowledge, and pursue our work
   We will show respect for different academic traditions and disciplines. We will promote equality and require tolerance across the boundaries of philosophy of life, culture and gender. We will
   contribute to diversity and equality of opportunity in working life and in our own activities. NTNU will be a sought-after workplace for students and staff. The environment for work and
   learning will reflect respect and thoughtfulness. Together we will lay the foundation for personal growth and development of skills.
   Our mission in society encompasses the expectations placed on NTNU by the nation as well as the world community, and the challenges in society that the university wishes to address. This is a
   As a university, NTNU has a particular responsibility for long-term basic research and academic development. We aim to offer research-based education at all levels, emphasizing postgraduate
   studies and doctoral degrees. We will disseminate knowledge and manage expertise in nature, culture, society and technology. NTNU will be a bearer of culture and will contribute to innovation
   Our main profile in science and technology gives us a particular responsibility to develop the technological foundation for the society of the future. Programmes of professional study at
   master's degree level are a strong point at NTNU.
   We will also work at the interface of technology, natural science, medicine, architecture, the humanities and social science. NTNU has a responsibility to offer university education in art and
   We will use our academic breadth and interdisciplinary expertise to solve complex problems and increase understanding of the relationships between technology, society and environment. We will
   take advantage of our unique qualifications to promote innovation and develop the knowledge base for sustainable value creation and a competitive business sector.
   It is the university's mission to participate in a knowledge-based public debate about important issues in society. We will use our knowledge to benefit society, and contribute to competence
   development in developing countries. We will engage in solving global challenges in health and welfare, energy and climate, the environment and use of resources. Our activities will promote
   human rights and intercultural dialogue.
   NTNU aims to become an outstanding university by international standards. This requires us to have world-class academic environments ourselves, and to seek collaboration with other leading
   knowledge communities in the world. In areas that are key to our mission in society, NTNU will take responsibility for building outstanding environments. We must set priorities for our
   resources so that we can provide development opportunities for the best teachers, researchers and academic groups, regardless of area.
   Our academic environments must concentrate their activities in order to create robust groups with quality at an international level. They must create adequate scope for the long-term basic
   research and take advantage of the opportunities that interdisciplinary collaboration provides to create unique results within their own subject. The academic environments must continue their
   close collaboration with the private and public sectors to develop the expertise that society needs.
   Motivated employees and students are a prerequisite to enable NTNU to achieve its objectives. Each individual has an independent responsibility to contribute to a fertile and favourable
     * The entire organization upholds quality at a high international level and several academic environments are in the top international league, measured by international peer review.
     * Our main profile and unique attributes provide an advantage in academic competition at the national and international level, and in collaboration with private- and public-sector
     * We attract the best students and staff, and are internationally renowned for the quality of our student life.
     * We will give priority to long-term basic research and enabling technologies, and create a sound infrastructure for these.<
     * We will give priority to research-based education for the working life of the future, and be a driving force in sustainable innovation.
     * Through priority setting and concentration of disciplines, we will create robust academic environments of high quality that have a distinctive profile.
     * We will create the scope and mechanisms needed to develop academic environments that rank in the top international league and to strengthen interdisciplinarity.
     * We will place greater emphasis on collaboration with leading centres of expertise in and outside Norway, and build on the strategic alliance with SINTEF and St. Olav's Hospital.
     * We will give priority to the work and learning environment at the university, and we will build on Trondheim's position as a leading student city.
   solve relevant problems and empower us to face the challenges of the future. Complex problems can be solved only with in-depth disciplinary knowledge and interdisciplinary collaboration. There
   must be a balance and interaction between applied and long-term basic research.
   NTNU's research and artistic activities are part of the international academic community, and all our academic environments have a responsibility to contribute actively to the development of
   subject areas and disciplines. As a knowledge nation, Norway must keep pace with international research, and as a large university we must aspire to leave a lasting impression.
   Internationalization is a prerequisite for development of high quality. Visibility at the national and international level makes us attractive for collaboration with the best players. This
   requires robust academic environments with a distinct profile, clear priorities, and disciplinary concentration. The environments must identify tomorrow's outstanding researchers and artists,
   and motivate students to pursue research. The doctoral programmes are a key instrument for renewing research and strengthening society's knowledge base.
     * All research and artistic activities uphold a high international level, and several scientific and artistic environments are in the top international league.
     * The research environments have a distinct profile that supports education and innovation, and that takes advantage of interdisciplinary links.
     * The research is long-term and fundamental. It contributes to international development of knowledge and creates the basis for future innovation.
     * NTNU's doctoral programmes are in demand and maintain a high international standard
     * We will identify and develop talents in research and art, and establish mechanisms to maintain and develop academic environments in the top international league.
     * We will concentrate our research through robust academic environments of high quality and with a clear academic profile.
     * We will strengthen the fundamental, long-term research and enabling technologies such as ICT, biotechnology and nanotechnology.
     * We will work to ensure that the public and private sectors seek and value doctoral graduates.
   There is a growing need for people with expertise who can tackle complex challenges in society. Competition for students is intensifying in the global education market; flexibility and ability
   to change are important. If we are to attract the most talented students and teaching staff, NTNU must take advantage of its unique attributes and develop a clear, ambitious profile for our
   academic portfolio. Studies must take place in a rich and inclusive learning environment. They must build on sound research and stimulate critical reflection and innovation.
   Alliances with strong academic environments at the national and international level create attractive programmes of study, increase the quality of the education and strengthen student mobility.

   Students must take responsibility for their own learning and be involved in the development of education programmes, teaching, and the learning environment. NTNU must provide students with
   close follow-up and evaluations that enhance learning. Leaders of education, teaching, and the learning environment must have clear roles and clear responsibility. The culture of quality
   improvement in the academic environments must be developed further, and the quality of education must be followed up continuously.
     * All the programmes of study are characterized by academic and teaching quality at a high international level.
     * NTNU has motivated students who are recruited nationally and internationally, and who can work across disciplinary boundaries and learning cultures.
     * The academic environments will concentrate the portfolio of studies to strengthen quality and give higher priority to international collaboration.
     * We will increase students' involvement in improvement of education quality and create a varied and favourable learning environment.

   NTNU has helped to build the Norway of today. Our ambition is to be an even more important contributor to sustainable value creation in the future. We must stimulate increased innovation
   throughout the breadth of NTNU's subject areas. This is to be clearly reflected in the education that we offer. Our interdisciplinary profile and experience in collaboration with society and
   business provide NTNU with a competitive advantage in innovation.
   Our innovation activities arise from education, research and artistic work. The entire process from ideas to new products and services must function optimally, and capacity for the education of
   entrepreneurs must increase. In cooperation with other players, NTNU must establish the basis for more spin-off companies and development in existing enterprises.
   Effective innovation requires closer, stronger and more professionalized collaboration with the private and public sectors. A broad base of research forms the foundation for ideas that are
     * NTNU is a driving force for adaptation and sustainable innovation in society.
     * NTNU is internationally outstanding within research-based innovation and collaboration with the private and public sectors.
     * NTNU has a well-functioning internal system for innovation, from ideas to spin-off companies.

   culture. We take a specific responsibility for science and technology. Dissemination must reflect the constantly changing landscape of knowledge.
   Dissemination of research outputs to the public must take place in an open dialogue with society. Feedback from the outside world must have an impact on both research and education, thus
   increasing the relevance of our activities. The dissemination of research competes for attention in the information society. NTNU must develop and apply innovative approaches and media.
   Effective dissemination and communication strengthen the institution's reputation. This can help to recruit talented staff and students, and make us an attractive partner for business and

   A village of buildings linked by glassed-over "streets", an art gallery, two working locomotives and a giant ocean basin for testing model ships are just a small sampling of what you'll find on

   Tyholt -- home to the marine technology programme

   For fun,  watch a video of two extremely athletic NTNU students as they free run through the university's main campuses.
   60,000 square metres, and is the largest building in Trondheim.Seven cafes and cafeterias serve hot drinks and a variety of food throughout the day.
   Libraries abound  - Three of NTNU's 11 libraries are located at the Gløshaugen campus - the main Technology Library, the Architecture, Civil Engineering and Product Design Library, and the
   Natural Science Library. NTNUI, the university's student athletic association, has a sports centre at the Gløshaugen campus where you can work out or take classes if you're an association
   Find the unexpected - The campus is full of surprises, not the least of which are two functioning locomotives, the Ohma Electra, an electric locomotive that's parked next to the Old electrical
   engineering building, and the Bjørkelangen, a steam locomotive that's parked next to the Varmeteknisk, Thermal energy building. Although the days are long gone when being an engineer just
   applied to operating locomotives, it seems fitting to find these reminders of the past at NTNU's main engineering campus.
   Dragvoll is the main campus for the Faculty of Humanities and the Faculty of Social Sciences and Technology Management, along with the Dragvoll Library, the main library for the arts, social
   sciences and humanities. The Dragvoll campus is divided into 12 buildings ("bygg") that are linked by "streets" that are glassed over, like a greenhouse, a design that resulted from an
   architecture contest in 1969. Three separate buildings, called pavilions, house the Centre for Rural Research and NTNU-Videre (Pavilion A), a private research company owned by NTNU called NTNU
   Samfunnsforsking AS (Pavilion B) and the Norwegian Centre for Child Research and the Department of Education (Pavilion C). The Dragvoll Sports Centre is located behind the pavilions, and
   contains two training halls, a gymnasium, a weight training hall, three squash courts, a climbing wall and a number of other facilities. SiT, the student services group, also has five
   cafeterias or kiosks where you can purchase food, along with a bookstore .
   The southern part of the Gløshaugen campus, down by the Rosenborg football club's stadium, is called Lerkendal/Valgrinda, and is home to a number of buildings occupied by SINTEF, Scandinavia's
   largest independent research institute, and a frequent partner in NTNU's research projects. Many SINTEF researchers also teach at NTNU, which is not surprising when you realize that the
   institute was a spin-off from NTNU's predecessor, NTH, in 1950. This campus is also home to the departments of Petroleum Engineering and Applied Geophysics, Production and Quality Engineering,
   and Hydraulic and Environmental Engineering, as well as the Valgrinda Library and NTNU Technology Transfer.
   Tyholt may be the most visible of NTNU's campuses, simply because of the colourful 120-metre high telecommunications tower that can be seen from throughout the city. NTNU's buildings at Tyholt
   may be somewhat less colourful than the tower, but they are every bit as impressive, for it's here that you'll find the Department of Marine Technology, right next to the Ship Model Tank,
   Cavitation Tunnel and the Ocean Basin Laboratory. The ocean research facilities are technically owned by MARINTEK, a branch of SINTEF, but are used widely in NTNU research. The Marine
   Technology Library, which is also shared between NTNU and MARINTEK, is also located here, as is a SiT cafeteria.
   Kalvskinnet, on the southern fringe of Trondheim's downtown, is home to the university's Museum of Natural History and Archaeology, as well as the Gunnerus Library, Norway's oldest scientific
   library. The library focuses on archaeology, botany, and zoology, but contains other natural science-related books. SiT has a Tapir bookstore and a cafeteria here as well.
   Down on the waterfront you'll find NTNU's own Sealab, or more formally, the NTNU Centre of Fisheries and Aquaculture, a shared research facility right in downtown Trondheim. Four of NTNU's
   Not surprisingly, NTNU's Department of Medicine is located here, with a host of research facilities, including the Kavli Centre for Systems Neuroscience/Centre for the Biology of Memory . SiT
   operates three cafeterias throughout the campus.
   Olavskvartalet features Trondheim's own concert hall, Olavshallen, where the Trondheim Symphony Orchestra regularly performs, and where NTNU's Department of Music has its music performance
   studies and music technology programmes. The Trondheim Academy of Fine Art is located across the Nidelva River from Olavshallen, in a fine building that also houses the academy's gallery.
   NTNU also has a number of far-flung research facilities, including the Ringve Botanical Garden, next to the Ringve Music Museum in Lade, the Department of Biology's Trondheim Biological
   Station, right on Trondheim fjord to the west of the city itself, and the Kongsvoll Biological Station, nearly three hours by car to the south, on the fringe of Dovrefjell National Park. Across
   from the biological station you'll find

The Norwegian Social Welfare System
   What is covered by the Norwegian system?
   The Norwegian social welfare system includes health care, disability payments, pensions and survivors benefits. It is administered by NAV, the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration. NTNU
   employees are also covered by the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund.
   Health care coverage and finding a doctor
   You become a member of the Norwegian National Health Scheme when you receive your national ID number. A few weeks after you receive your ID number you should receive a mailing from NAV in which
   you are assigned a general practitioner (called fastlege in Norwegian). Health insurance coverage for non-Norwegian students is a little different and depends on what country the student is
   from. NTNU students, regardless of nationality, have access to a clinic at Gløshaugen. There is also easy access to student mental health counselling, located in the Moholt studentby.
   clinics in the greater Trondheim area, with another two dozen throughout the county. Adults can also be treated at these public clinics, or at a private practititioner's office (in Norwegian).
   There is also a dentist on call on weekends and holidays who can be reached by calling 73 50 55 00, but be aware that if you are an adult, this service costs 75% more than a normal dentist's
   The greater Trondheim area is served by a number of chemists, or pharmacies (called apotek in Norwegian), most of which are typically open from 0900-1800 on weekdays and from 0900 to 1500 on
   There are a number of pharmacies near the hospital, and the hospital itself maintains a branch pharmacy that is open until midnight every day of the week at Solsiden, at Beddingen 4 (map), in
   Doctors can write two types of prescriptions; one, on blue paper, is a medication that you must have to treat a health problem. These types of prescriptions are covered by the health insurance
   scheme, and so you as the patient pay only a nominal cost for the drug. Prescriptions written on white paper, for medicine that is not medically necessary, can also be filled at the pharmacy,
   but the patient bears the full cost of the drug. Full-time NTNU students are eligible for a refund for a portion of their medical and dental costs.

   Apply for a visa via Application Portal Norway if you can.
   The Directorate for Immigration (UDI) is moving to an online application process, although it will still be necessary to bring supporting documents to a consulate or embassy. You can find the
   Application Portal online along with an interactive web page that enables you to determine if your circumstances will allow you to make your preliminary application on line.
   You can also check out the Trondheim Immigration Office's Facebook page.
   But... do you need a visa?
   All international students, visiting researchers and newly hired employees who are going to stay in Norway for more than 3 months must have a valid residence/work permit. The requirements may
   be slightly different for students depending upon your home country, your location when you apply for a permit and your source of funding. You can find a detailed description of the
   requirements for students on the UDI web page.
   If you are a resident of the EU/EFTA/EEA you have the right to live and work in Norway for up to three months, but you must register yourself with the police.
   Applications for most permits can be done via the Application Portal Norway, as above, but you will need to submit supporting documents to the appropriate embassy.
   Note that if you plan to bring your family with you to Norway, you will all need to go together at some point to show officials your family -- the Immigration officials will want to physically

   Processing times can be long
   Once submitted, processing times for work permits can vary anywhere from 1-4 months. A letter confirming you have been granted a work/residence permit will be sent in the mail.
   The application forms for Non EU/ EEA countries are different than those for applicants from EU/EEA countries, and are different for individuals who are coming with a family or alone. While we
   have tried to summarize what you need below, there are so many small details that the best idea is to go directly to the UDI website for visa applications.

Norwegian Taxes
   Paying taxes in Norway requires that you have both a national identity number (fødselsnummer) and a tax card (skattekord). If you will only be in Norway for a short period, you may be issued a
   temporary D number. As a foreigner, you may also be entitled to a 10% tax reduction for your first 2 years in Norway.
   Both the national ID number and the temporary D number are 11 digits; the national ID number starts with your birthdate and ends in 5 randomly generated digits. You'll need this number to get
   paid, to open a bank account and to pay taxes. Skattetatten, the Norwegian Tax Authority, has an online explanation of tax requirements in English that should be enough to get you started.
   You can apply for either a D-number or a national identity number at the Trondheim tax office, although you actually will file for this number from the National Register, which is co-located
   with the Tax Office. You must plan for it to take some time to get an ID number. Depending upon the time of year and the national registry's workload, you may have to wait several weeks or
   months. You have to fill out the form called "Notification to the National Registry of move to Norway from abroad." Bring your passport with residence/work permit stamp. You don't need to do
   this if you are from the other Nordic countries. Newcomers should make certain they have enough cash to cover expenses until they obtain one of these all-important numbers.
   Once you have been issued an ID number, you must return to the Tax Office and apply for a tax card. It is possible to get a tax card before getting an ID number. To do so, take your job
   contract and passport to the tax office. An informational brochure is available there.
   The tax card is used as a basis for withholding tax from salaries paid to employees working in Norway. Make sure that your employer has received your tax card before you get your first salary
   -- otherwise a 50% tax will automatically be withheld from your salary. If you have paid too much tax, you will get it back in your annual tax refund. Have your job contract and documentation
   of your expected salary with you when you go to the tax office.
   A personal tax return will be sent to your registered address in the spring of the year following the income year. The tax return is to be completed and submitted to the tax authorities by
   April 30 in the year following the income year. You will receive an End of the Year Certificate (Årsoppgave) from your employer with some basic information on the salary and allowances you have
   The final tax assessment is sent to your registered address in either June or October in the year following the income year. It provides information on the basis for taxation in Norway, such as
   taxable income, tax paid, if you have overpaid or underpaid tax, etc. The tax assessment will normally correspond with the information submitted in your personal tax return, but should always
   be double checked. For further information on the Norwegian tax system and regulations go to www.skatteetaten.no

   For a city of its size, Trondheim offers a good variety of schooling alternatives for Norwegians and non-Norwegians alike. There are two English-language international schools: Birralee, which
   offers schooling based on the British National Curriculum, or the Trondheim International School, which is certified as an International Baccalaureate school for grades 1-10. At the moment, the
   Norwegian government subsidizes alternative schooling programmes such as international schools, so that the fees they charge are relatively low, typically around NOK 2000 per month.
   Parents can also choose a Steiner (Waldorf) School (in Norwegian), but the language of instruction there is Norwegian.
   You can also send your school-aged children to the Trondheim school system, where they'll be integrated into the local school classroom and offered special tutoring in Norwegian. Broadly
   speaking, the Norwegian school system is governed by a national curriculum; note that one surprise for some non-Norwegians is that Christian knowledge and religious and ethical education are a

   High performance computing at NTNU is centred around a supercomputer called Njord, named after the Norwegian god who is the protector of seafarers and fishermen and who sends favourable winds
   Njord is an IBM p575+ interconnected with a high-bandwidth low-latency switch network (HPS). When it was installed in August of 2006, it was one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe,
   and doubled Norway's supercomputing capacity in one fell swoop. NTNU's researchers use the machine for a variety of projects, including helping with the study of quantum transport in magnetic
   semiconductors and bioinformatics. The Norwegian Meterological Institute also uses time on the machine to create more detailed and real-time weather forecasts.
   For those who are curious about the technical details, Njord has a total of 65 nodes partitioned into 59 compute nodes, 4 I/O nodes and 2 login nodes. All 59 compute nodes are shared memory
   nodes with 8 dual-core power5+ processors 1.9 Ghz. Four of the compute nodes have 128 GB memory, while the remaining 55 have 32 GB of memory. The system is well-suited for large-scale parallel
   Although Njord is happily ensconced at NTNU, all high performance computing in Norway is controlled by a cooperative called NOTUR, which ensures that computing time on the country's four
   supercomputers is properly allocated. You can read more about NOTUR, including about how to apply for computer time, on the consortium's own web pages.
   NOTUR, the Norwegian Metacenter for Computational Science, oversees the allocation of time for Norway's 4 high performance computers. In addition to NTNU's Njord, Norway is home to Hexagon, a
   Cray XT4 computer housed at the University of Bergen; Stallo, a Cluster Platform 3000 BL460c at the University of Tromsø; and Titan, a Sun X2200 at the University of Oslo. NTNU students and
   researchers can apply to NOTUR to use time on any of these machines as needed. For more information contact NOTUR at info@notur.no

   The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) cooperates with selected partner countries in accordance with stipulated national priorities in Norway. Cooperation in research and
   education is established with about 200 universities all over the world. Our prioritized geographical areas are the EU, the USA, Japan and China. NTNU has proved to be an attractive partner
   European projects
   NTNU is an active partner in the European Research Area, and has participated in the European Commission's Framework Programmes (FP) for Research and Technological Development since FP4.
   Participation in FP7 is one of the highest priority areas for the university. NTNU and SINTEF are together involved in a large majority of the European Technology Platforms that are supported
   by the European Commission. In FP6, NTNU is a contractual partner in about 60 projects, which have a total budget of EUR 250 million over a four-year period.
   Our proximity to the large oil and gas fields in the North Sea/Norwegian Sea and our close cooperation with the companies operating these fields has over the years built up world-class research
   industrial partners. The European Technology Platform ZEP (Zero Emission Fossil Fuel Power Plants) is a good example of such work. The mobility of researchers and transnational access to
   Research Infrastructures is a vital aspect of international research cooperation. Projects funded by the European Commission are designed to open up the scientific know-how and laboratory
   facilities in Europe for the benefit of the entire European research community. For example, ENGAS (Environmental Gas Management) has helped to put NTNU firmly on the international scientific
   education in four areas: sustainability, energy systems, nanotechnology and biotechnology. NTNU is also closely involved with the Kyoto International Forum for Environment and Energy which is
   an international arena for strategic cooperation to realize sustainable society inspired by the Kyoto protocol. Another example is the Transition to Sustainable Energy Services in Northern
   supply of sustainable energy to northern Europe. NTNU also cooperates in energy research with Tsinghua University, China. This work is concentrated on hydrogen and fuel cells, materials
   When disasters happen, what should the international aid agencies do? Researchers in NTNU's Internal Displacement Project at the Department of Geography have some suggestions concerning Sri
   Lanka's post-crisis reconstruction. This project is funded by the Research Council of Norway.
   NTNU has established international networks directed towards the developing countries. This work is coordinated by the Norwegian Centre for International Cooperation in Higher Education in
   projects that form part of the Norwegian Cooperation Programme for Development, Research and Higher Education (NUFU). NTNU is doing research and development in solar energy with the Eduardo
   Mondlane University in Mozambique. Close cooperation is established with a corresponding project at University of Durban Westville, in South Africa. Another NUFU project is research in marine
   SINTEF plays a major role in the Water Supply and Sanitation Technology Platform. Researchers in this group are renowned for their scientific R&D far beyond the borders of Europe.
   Due to their central position in the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics network staff at NTNU are given easy access to the European research community and the European
   ICT industry. This strategic area participates in 6 networks of excellence in FP6.

   The European Aquaculture Technology Platform was initiated by SINTEF and NTNU, with the aim to gather European stakeholders in the field to define future research needs and a vision for the
   sector. NTNU's in-depth knowledge base and many years of industrial cooperation provided a firm basis for this initiative.
   NTNU is also involved in other European Commission-supported initiatives to stimulate transnational R&D cooperation in this sector. For example, HYDRALAB III provides transnational access to
   the Trondheim Marine Systems Research Infrastructure .There is also Design-ACT that is designing the Aquaculture Centre of Technology - to face the unmet needs in European aquaculture
   Marine research cooperation between NTNU and the University of Nagasaki, Japan is focused on aquaculture and the production of marine fry. There is also R&D cooperation in this sector between
   NTNU and the Ocean University of China in Qingdao.
   Light metals have a long history at NTNU. This is due to the Norwegian aluminium industry. When used in cars, ships and aircraft there is a huge demand for light metals research and innovation.
   NTNU's prominent scientific position in this field has led to participation in several European Commission-funded projects and the national Centre for Research-based Innovation (SIMLab) with
   the close involvement of the European car industry. Another project that is important for this strategic area is the Kyoto International Forum for Environment and Energy (see above: energy)
   Both NTNU and SINTEF are members in the European Technology Platform on nanomedicine, which is based on cooperation between the main European stakeholders in industry and academia aiming for
   Harvard/MIT that results in the exchange of professors, PhD and master's students in connection with joint research projects.

Background to the Ethics Portal
     * An Internet portal on ethics and research ethics has been created as a teaching and supervision resource for staff and students/ PhD candidates at NTNU.
       - Users with a focus on particular problems or disciplines
       - Users with a specialized interest in ethics (networks, events, teaching, research, journals, people, news, links, and more)
     * The web pages of the Programme for Applied Ethics, easily accessible from the Ethics Portal, will be especially useful to the second, and in particular the third group of users.The focus
     * The task of developing the Ethics Portal has been assigned to the Programme for Applied Ethics
   Two working groups have been involved. The first was a committee established by the University Central Research Committee through Astrid Lægreid in the autumn of 2006. From the autumn of 2008,
   a new group established by the director of the human resources division continued work on the material. Personnel matters were now included in the content. The Programme for Applied Ethics,
   represented by May Thorseth, has had the primary responsibility for the work.
   The result has a multidisciplinary and inter-faculty foundation, with contributions from professors/heads of departments, the doctoral candidates' organization DION, heads of sections, safety
   representatives, NTNU's legal adviser, vice-deans and pro-rectors. Heads of sections and DION have contributed in interviews, while the others have either been included in the working groups or
   as pilot testers. Those involved have given their consent for use of the cases and comments in anonymized form.
   Ethical reasons for the Ethics Portal
   In an ideal world we would not need research ethics -- all researchers would understand the need for compliance with certain standards, such as specifying the source of references, giving
   credit to co-workers, being open about sources of knowledge, obtaining consent from research subjects, etc. Identifying research ethics as a separate field is an acknowledgement that
   researchers do not live in an ideal world (even if Plato believed that philosophers could do so). There are two ways of looking at this: (1) It is regrettable that researchers do not act in
   line with their ideals, and must therefore submit to the introduction of external rules for their own activities. (2) It is good that researchers live in a world adapted to human reality, and
   Our point of departure is that it is good for researchers to have an honest recognition of their fallibility. Then it is also reassuring to know that potential whistle-blowers and others can
   step in if necessary. We believe that, most of the time, the great majority of researchers do not make significant mistakes, and that most have a well-trained alarm system to alert them when
   When the alarm does not sound automatically
   In other words, there is a need to focus on some key points in the plethora of written and unwritten rules for good research. The ethical perspective is an important aspect of good research in
   general. Good research means research of high quality. There are many criteria for evaluating the quality of research, but there is no invariable standard that applies in the same way to every
   subject. At the national level plan we have committees for research ethics in various disciplines, and at the regional/local level there are regional committees for evaluating research projects
   Brief reflection on the intersection between law, ethics and morals
   The issue of high quality in research requires legal guidelines, and we have many of those. So many that researchers come to perceive them as a problem, both because it is difficult to keep
   track of them all, and because there are ethical and moral questions that cannot be answered exclusively by referring to the law. The most important issue, however, is: How to get researchers
   to produce qualitatively good research on the basis of the right motivation? This question directs a critical spotlight on the growing tendency toward external control without an inner sense of
   justice. An example is the difference between refraining from dishonesty because it carries penalties if you are discovered, and because it conflicts with the inherent research ethos of

   specialization profile. Our specialization courses can also be taken as part of a Bachelor's (or even Master's) degree with a main subject area other than Philosophy.
   The Master's degree is a two-year full-time study awarding 120 ECTS credits. The programme focuses on meta-theoretical and methodological aspects of Philosophy before the student embarks on
   supervised work culminating in the Master's thesis. Master's/Postgraduate students are also encouraged to make use of the specialization courses offered, in their areas of interest (see above).
   The Department is also responsible for the Introductory course in Philosophy. It is a compulsory introductory course for all students at Norwegian universities. Furthermore, the Department
   offers teaching in connection with the course Introduction to Neuroscience at the Faculty of Medicine and a Theory of Science course for PhD students at the Faculty of Humanities.

   the publications should correspond to the people and affiliations that have already been entered into Cristin. It is essential that you enter your correct NTNU affiliation  when you submit a
   work for publication. If you as a researcher notice that your publications have not been included in the central data import, it is your responsibility to get them listed. In addition to these
   publications, other types of research results can be listed in Cristin: reports, abstracts, presentations, posters, exhibitions, videos, interviews, editorials, feature articles, book reviews
Log in to Cristin using your NTNU credentials (make sure you pre-select your institution, NTNU). Click 'Research Results/NVI' and the sub-category 'Register result' and follow the process. The
     * Before registering a new publication, click on the link for publications in your own Cristin profile to make sure that it is not already registered or imported.
     * When you register a new publication, your affiliation must be entered in the same manner as in the publication itself. Click on the 'house' icon on the screen to change your affiliation.
     * Co-authors should be entered correctly, by listing their name/s and affiliation/s as written in the publication. If possible, choose the name with (P).
     * Include the DOI of your publication in the appropriate field whenever possible.
If you publish in a lesser-known peer-reviewed journal or publisher, please ensure that the journal or publisher is recognized at the tier 1 or 2 level, using the Database for Statistics and Higher
Education. Not all journals are assigned a tier. Nominations for the listing of journals as tier 1 are handled by the Norwegian Social Sciences Data Services (NSD). Nominations of journals to be
promoted from tier 1 to tier 2 are handled by the Publications Board at the Norwegian Association of Higher Education Institutions (UHR) according to recommendations from national advisory boards for
The registration of publications in Cristin generates points which are used by national assessment authorities as a basis for the evaluation of academic research, which is carried out on a
quantitative basis. This evaluation in turn provides information in determining national budget allocations to universities. In situations where there are several authors, the points are divided
between the authors.
     Once you have logged into Cristin, the question marks in the upper right hand corner of your Cristin pages can provide help with the following tasks:
   Each faculty has responsibility for introducing the system to its researchers and providing instruction in its use. In addition to the faculty "super user", who has extended editing rights and
   permissions, each department has a contact person who can assist researchers with the Cristin system.
