Quota Scheme

   Master's degree programmes

   The Norwegian Quota Scheme is a funding Scheme offered by the Norwegian Government to students from developing countries in the South and countries in the Western Balkans, Eastern Europe and in
   Central Asia. The goal of the Quota Scheme is to give students relevant education that will also benefit their home countries when the return after graduation.

   Please see more information about the Quota Scheme at the webpage for the Norwegian Centre for International Cooperation in Higher Education (SiU)
   Applicants, who live in another country than their country of citizenship, either temporarily or permanently, can not apply.

   Only applicants from institutions with which NTNU has a formal cooperation agreement are eligible to apply.

   You may be eligible for financial support under the Quota Scheme if you are permanently or temporary employed or if you are a student with a first degree or are presently studying at one of the
   institutions where NTNU has a formal cooperation agreement. Preference is given to applicants who are linked to active and formalized cooperation/projects within the specific subject area.

   To be eligible, you must also have stayed at least one year in your home country directly prior to when you plan to undertake your education to NTNU. This means that you cannot apply for
   financial support from another country than your own.

Placement is competitive

   The few Quota seats available, compared to the high number of applicants competing, make this source of funding extremely competitive.

   Due to few Quota Seats available, not all MSc/MPhil programmes will be allocated with Quota Seats, the decision will be made internally at NTNU in November.
   Please note that there are no PhD places available for 2013-2014.
   Students should still apply for the programme they are interested in and qualified for, but unfortunately, we can not guarantee that all programmes will be allocated Quota Seats.

   Application deadline: 1 December
