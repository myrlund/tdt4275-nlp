   Cristin-logo     Current Research Information System In Norway

   List a scientific publication in Cristin  (use your NTNU password)
   Search the Cristin database

All research results that have been entered into the Cristin database are linked to the individual researcher's Cristin profile.

What should be entered

The following types of results must be entered into the database:

     * Academic articles in journals or in academic series with an ISSN
     * Academic monographs
     * Academic articles in anthologies

   The organization that operates Cristin will conduct a central data import from the bibliographical data sources ISI Web of Science, Norart and BIBSYS. This means that the author affiliations in
   the publications should correspond to the people and affiliations that have already been entered into Cristin. It is essential that you enter your correct NTNU affiliation  when you submit a
   work for publication. If you as a researcher notice that your publications have not been included in the central data import, it is your responsibility to get them listed. In addition to these
   publications, other types of research results can be listed in Cristin: reports, abstracts, presentations, posters, exhibitions, videos, interviews, editorials, feature articles, book reviews
   and forms of artistic content.

How to register publications
Log in to Cristin using your NTNU credentials (make sure you pre-select your institution, NTNU). Click 'Research Results/NVI' and the sub-category 'Register result' and follow the process. The
following notes will help ensure that you enter your publication correctly:

     * Before registering a new publication, click on the link for publications in your own Cristin profile to make sure that it is not already registered or imported.
     * When you register a new publication, your affiliation must be entered in the same manner as in the publication itself. Click on the 'house' icon on the screen to change your affiliation.
     * Co-authors should be entered correctly, by listing their name/s and affiliation/s as written in the publication. If possible, choose the name with (P).
     * Include the DOI of your publication in the appropriate field whenever possible.

Tier 1 and 2 publications

If you publish in a lesser-known peer-reviewed journal or publisher, please ensure that the journal or publisher is recognized at the tier 1 or 2 level, using the Database for Statistics and Higher
Education. Not all journals are assigned a tier. Nominations for the listing of journals as tier 1 are handled by the Norwegian Social Sciences Data Services (NSD). Nominations of journals to be
promoted from tier 1 to tier 2 are handled by the Publications Board at the Norwegian Association of Higher Education Institutions (UHR) according to recommendations from national advisory boards for
each discipline.
Publication points
The registration of publications in Cristin generates points which are used by national assessment authorities as a basis for the evaluation of academic research, which is carried out on a
quantitative basis. This evaluation in turn provides information in determining national budget allocations to universities. In situations where there are several authors, the points are divided
between the authors.

CRISTIN HELP

   Authorized channels; tier 1 and 2

     Once you have logged into Cristin, the question marks in the upper right hand corner of your Cristin pages can provide help with the following tasks:
     * registering publications or other research results
     * editing your own profile, projects, and research units in English

   Each faculty has responsibility for introducing the system to its researchers and providing instruction in its use. In addition to the faculty "super user", who has extended editing rights and
   permissions, each department has a contact person who can assist researchers with the Cristin system.
