Projects

   The Faculty of Humanities is involved in many different projects. The ones that have English-language websites are presented here. You will find more information about these and other projects
   by visiting the Departments' websites.

   Department of Philosophy

   Programme for Applied Ethics: An interdisciplinary programme that aims to develop the ethical competance among research staff and students.

   Department of Archaeology and Religious Studies

   European Forum for the Study of Religion and the Environment: A European co-operative project which promotes scholarly and critical inquiry into the relationships between human beings and their
   diverse cultures, environments and religious beliefs and practices.

   Creativity and Craft Production in Middle and Late Bronze Age Europe (CinBA): CinBA offers important insights into the fundamental nature of creativity by exploring a part of European history
   not influenced by contemporary concepts of art - the Bronze Age - looking at developments in crafts that we take for granted today: pottery, textiles and metalwork.

   Department of History and Classical Studies

   The Realm of Norway: The aim of the project, which is sponsored by the Norwegian Council of Research, is to undertake an analysis of the `Norgesveldet' as a political system. Our ambition is to
   study the Norwegian realm in the Middle Ages from a common Norse or West-Nordic perspective, and not a national one, be that Norwegian, Icelandic or Scottish or Swedish for that matter.

   Department of Modern Foreign Languages

   Exhibiting Europe. The Construction of European Integration and Identity in the Musée de l'Europe: Europe wants to be collected, but it has no collection. This tension serves as a starting
   point for the research project Exhibiting Europe. Taking into account the gap between ambition and the reality of a specific European narrative in museums, collections and exhibitions, our
   research addresses various topics.

   Translating cultures: Research group at the Department.

   Language and cognition: Language acquisition and language processing: Research group at the Department studying the relationship between language and cognition, i.e. how we learn languages -
   both first and second, how linguistic categories are formed and how we understand and process language.

   The Trondheim Forum for Eighteenth-Century Studies: Research group at the Department.

   Department of Music

   Jazz: The Jazz programme is part of the Music Performance programme.

   Department of Scandinavian Studies and Comparative Literature

   Transcultural aesthetics: The primary objectives of the project are to shed light on the dialogue between contemporary literature and central aspects of today's media culture, and to develop
   analytical tools that will better enable us to understand and describe the esthetic norms, values and positions that this literature conveys.

   Department of Language and Communication Studies

   Health communication: Research group at the Department. The aim is to consolidate discourse and communication research in the area of health communication in Norway.

   TypeCraft: TypeCraft is a multi-lingual on-line database of linguistically-annotated natural language text, embedded in a collaboration and information tool.
