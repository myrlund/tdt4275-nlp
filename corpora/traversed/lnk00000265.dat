Program declaration SSTL

   Theoretical Linguistics, including General Phonetics, has been a sustained field of education and research at NTNU for nearly 40 years. While in the beginning located only in the Department of
   Language and Communication Studies (ISK), the discipline of Theoretical Linguistics is now a very active and internationally oriented field also in the Department of Scandinavian Studies and
   Comparative Literature (INL) and the Department of Modern Foreign Languages (IFS).

   In General Phonetics, the phonetics group at ISK has a unique position being the only place in Norway that has phonetic research and teaching as its prime institutional responsibility, and the
   ISK phoneticians contribute to theoretical and applied research (e.g. speech synthesis and speech recognition), with a wide circle of cooperation partners locally (both in their own Faculty and
   at Gløshaugen) as well as internationally. In Theoretical Linguistics proper, the level of activity is reflected both in a richness of theoretical approaches (including LFG, HPSG, GB,
   Minimalism), which is exceptional on a world basis, and in research networks, spanning not only networks devoted to the study of Scandinavian languages and their dialects, but also, in Europe
   the other Germanic languages (English and German) and the Balkan and South Slavic area, and in Asia especially East and South Asian languages (Mandarin Chinese, the languages of India), and in
   Africa all of the three main linguistic areas Bantu, Ethio-Semitic and West-African. Furthermore, the linguistic effects of globalization, as witnessed in accelerating phenomena of language
   contact and language change in many parts of the globe, have become thriving fields of research in all three departments, especially as it relates to first, second, and third language
   acquisition, but research on linguistic identity and on minority and majority languages is also in vogue. Experimental methods are widely used, for instance in the Phonetics Lab at ISK and in
   the Language Acquisition and Language Processing Lab at IFS.

   As linguistic theory and formalism consolidated throughout the 70s and 80s, giving rise to the development of computational tools and applications, linguists at ISK performed a development of
   computational lexical resources during the late 80s and 90s which is still outstanding internationally, and from early 2000 these resources have become supplemented by state of the art
   grammatical and semantic analysis tools. Digital documentation of language resources has correspondingly been a key activity, where the groups at NTNU, apart from the documentation of
   Norwegian, have also been involved in documentation of Old Slavic and of six African languages. In particular, one may mention the breaking of new empirical and theoretical ground in
   dialectology through the investigation and documentation of Norwegian and Scandinavian dialect syntax done at INL. This work is done in collaboration with several other universities in the
   Nordic countries, through the Nordic Center of Excellence of Microcomparative Syntax (NORMS), and through the ScanDiaSyn and NorDiaSyn networks/projects.

   Theoretically sustained research on language acquisition and language development are thriving new fields in all three departments. At ISK, this research is primarily done in the phonetics
   group and in applied linguistics. IFS and INL collaborate on various subprojects centering on the comparative and acquisitional study of Mandarin Chinese, English, and Norwegian. Also, in the
   Language Acquisition and Language Processing Lab at IFS language skills in children and adults are investigated. Experimental research on language acquisition (first language acquisition with
   children and second language acquisition with adults) as well as on language processing (for instance comprehension and categorisation) is done with the aim of finding out how humans develop
   their abilities to understand and reflect on the world around them and to talk about it.

   A common denominator of the theoretical approaches both in linguistics and phonetics and the computational developments is the idea of genericity: In theoretical linguistic research, a key
   assumption is that human languages are largely based on a common design. This assumption is fundamental for the comparative theoretical and empirical research being done at INL and IFS, seeking
   to develop e.g. Scandinavian and English linguistics as research disciplines beyond their traditional limits of descriptive one-language focus. In language technology, the corresponding
   assumption is bi-pronged: (1) when building computational applications involving language, the linguistic systems should be the same whether the application is ma¬chine translation, text
   summary, grammar checking, robot navigation, etc.; (2) reflecting the theoretical genericity assumption, in language technology, multilingual shared design and reusability of resources are key
   desiderata. Through the combined ongoing efforts of the theoretical, acquisitional and computational groups, the groups are constructing genericity-based designs and products that aim beyond
   the current state of the art, with a basis in soundly used existing analytic and computational practice.
