Centres of Excellence and Strategic Areas

   NTNU's research runs the gamut from exploring how the brain works to creating the technologies that allow oil, water and gas to travel safely hundreds of kilometres through the same pipe. You
   can read more about our centres of excellence and other research cooperatives below.

NTNU's three Centres of Excellence

   Long-term, basic research today provides the foundation for innovative discoveries of tomorrow. NTNU is committed to providing the resources and expertise for scientists to conduct basis
   research.

   The Research Council of Norway has acknowledged this effort by awarding NTNU three Centres of Excellence:
     * Centre for Quantifiable Quality of Service (Q2S)

     * Centre for Ships and Ocean Structure (CeSOS)

     * Kavli Institute/Centre for the Biology of Memory (KI/CBM)

Centres for Research-based Innovation

   Industry plays in important role in helping develop Norwegian technologies and bring them to markets worldwide.

   In 2006, the Research Council of Norway created Centres for Research-based Innovation as a way to build on the synergies that come from pairing world-class researchers with innovative
   companies. NTNU is home to three of these centres:

   Medical Imaging Laboratory for Innovative Future Healthcare

   Structural Impact Laboratory

   Centre for Integrated Operations in the Petroleum Industry

Centres for Environment-friendly Energy Research

   Can we solve the energy crisis?

   The Research Centres for Environmentally friendly Energy (CEER) were established by Research Council of Norway in the wake of the Norwegian Climate Convention. These centres conduct long-term
   research at a high international standard, with the aim of tackling energy-related challenges. NTNU is the lead university for ZEB - the Research Centre on Zero Emission Buildings, and is
   involved in five other centres.
     * ZEB - The Research Centre on Zero Emission Buildings
     * Research Centre for Offshore Wind Technology.
     * BIGCCS Centre - International CCS Research Centre
     * CEDREN - Centre for Environmental Design of Renewable Energy
     * CenBio - Bioenergy Innovation Centre
     * The Norwegian Research Centre for Solar Cell Technology

Strategic Research Areas

   NTNU has designated six strategic areas that have formed networks across faculties and departments to bring the best minds to work on cross-disciplinary subjects.
