Strategy for the Faculty of Humanities, 2012 - 2020

Vision

   The Faculty of Humanities (HF) should be a humanistic force in a technical and scientific university as well as in society at large and the realm of the arts and culture. HF will offer studies
   and conduct research in the core areas of the field. The faculty will also play an active role in the development of interdisciplinarity. Practical, aesthetic and artistic activities should be
   a central part of the faculty profile. The faculty's academic activities must also be of a quality that is recognized in its international academic peer relationships.

Values

   Summer at Dragvoll campus The Faculty of Humanities takes as its basic operating values the ideas of "creative, critical and constructive". The faculty will further the values of the European
   university tradition and promote knowledge, critical reflection, tolerance and fairness. All academic activities will be characterized by openness, curiosity and respect for other disciplines
   and traditions. The faculty will educate individuals to provide them insight and understanding, and the ability to undertake ethical reflection, to equip them with the ability to assume their
   local and global social responsibilities.

The Faculty of Humanities' social mission

   The academic activities of the faculty are based on strong academic disciplines. With this as its foundation, the faculty will execute its social mission by contributing to the development of
   democratic attitudes and understanding. We will prioritize outstanding professional work, interdisciplinarity and social relevance.
   Our multi-disciplinary environment in climate and energy research should be expanded to 2020, along with the disciplines of music technology, cultural heritage management and applied ethics.
   Our faculty has been central in the creation of these areas, and will continue to initiate the establishment of new ones. The five-year integrated teacher education programme is being fostered
   now and will be given priority in the future. We should also prepare for areas that have the potential for excellence beyond what we know today.

Research and artistic activities
