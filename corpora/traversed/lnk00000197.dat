Education plan changes

   Choosing your plan of study at NTNU is important for many reasons -- but one of the most important is that it can be very difficult to make changes after you've been accepted.

   When you are admitted to the IFUS programme, you are also accepted to a specific programme of study for a specified length of time. Unfortunately, if you change your mind it can be quite
   difficult to alter your study plans -- changes usually are denied. It is therefore important that you carefully consider your application choices.

   Your Norwegian residence permit is granted on the basis of an "Admission Letter". Any changes made to the education plan or length of study time may therefore jeopardize this permit. Any
   changes to the education plan must be approved by the Office of International Relations, and will normally come only as a result of an evaluation of previous education.

   If you decide to change your education plan, contact the coordinator at the Office of International Relations as soon as possible. The coordinator will carefully go through your plans with you,
   and if they are acceptable recommend that your student permit is extended. Note that such changes usually require that the student applies through NUCAS (the Norwegian Universities and Colleges
   Admission Service, or Samordnet Opptak).

   Credit transfer
   Please note that the Norwegian academic system and the NTNU grading system may differ from what you are used to in your home country. This might complicate credit transfer matters and it is
   therefore extremely important that you consider this in your plans for study at NTNU. The Office of International Relations will guide all students accepted to the IFUS program through the
   process of evaluation and in drawing up the final education plan upon arrival.
