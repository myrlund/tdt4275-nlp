NTNU Campuses

   A village of buildings linked by glassed-over "streets", an art gallery, two working locomotives and a giant ocean basin for testing model ships are just a small sampling of what you'll find on
   NTNU's campuses.

What you'll find where:

   Gløshaugen -- the main science and technology campus
   Dragvoll -- the main humanities campus
   Lerkendal/Valgrinda -- a shared campus with SINTEF
   Tyholt -- home to the marine technology programme
   Kalvskinnet -- home to NTNU's Natural History museum
   Øya -- the hospital campus
   Olavskvartalet -- music at Olavshallen, arts and architecture across the river
   Other research stations -- Ringve botanical garden in Lade, and farther afield

   For fun,  watch a video of two extremely athletic NTNU students as they free run through the university's main campuses.

Gløshaugen

   Realfagbygget The Faculties of Engineering Science and Technology, Natural Sciences and Technology, and Information Technology, Mathematics and Electrical Engineering are all found here.
   Gløshaugen is also home to NTNU's first building, the Hovedbygningen, completed in 1910, and Realfagbygget, the natural sciences building, opened in 2000. Realfagbygget covers approximately
   60,000 square metres, and is the largest building in Trondheim.Seven cafes and cafeterias serve hot drinks and a variety of food throughout the day.

   Libraries abound  - Three of NTNU's 11 libraries are located at the Gløshaugen campus - the main Technology Library, the Architecture, Civil Engineering and Product Design Library, and the
   Natural Science Library. NTNUI, the university's student athletic association, has a sports centre at the Gløshaugen campus where you can work out or take classes if you're an association
   member.

   Find the unexpected - The campus is full of surprises, not the least of which are two functioning locomotives, the Ohma Electra, an electric locomotive that's parked next to the Old electrical
   engineering building, and the Bjørkelangen, a steam locomotive that's parked next to the Varmeteknisk, Thermal energy building. Although the days are long gone when being an engineer just
   applied to operating locomotives, it seems fitting to find these reminders of the past at NTNU's main engineering campus.

Dragvoll Dragvoll

   Dragvoll is the main campus for the Faculty of Humanities and the Faculty of Social Sciences and Technology Management, along with the Dragvoll Library, the main library for the arts, social
   sciences and humanities. The Dragvoll campus is divided into 12 buildings ("bygg") that are linked by "streets" that are glassed over, like a greenhouse, a design that resulted from an
   architecture contest in 1969. Three separate buildings, called pavilions, house the Centre for Rural Research and NTNU-Videre (Pavilion A), a private research company owned by NTNU called NTNU
   Samfunnsforsking AS (Pavilion B) and the Norwegian Centre for Child Research and the Department of Education (Pavilion C). The Dragvoll Sports Centre is located behind the pavilions, and
   contains two training halls, a gymnasium, a weight training hall, three squash courts, a climbing wall and a number of other facilities. SiT, the student services group, also has five
   cafeterias or kiosks where you can purchase food, along with a bookstore .

Lerkendal/Valgrinda

   The southern part of the Gløshaugen campus, down by the Rosenborg football club's stadium, is called Lerkendal/Valgrinda, and is home to a number of buildings occupied by SINTEF, Scandinavia's
   largest independent research institute, and a frequent partner in NTNU's research projects. Many SINTEF researchers also teach at NTNU, which is not surprising when you realize that the
   institute was a spin-off from NTNU's predecessor, NTH, in 1950. This campus is also home to the departments of Petroleum Engineering and Applied Geophysics, Production and Quality Engineering,
   and Hydraulic and Environmental Engineering, as well as the Valgrinda Library and NTNU Technology Transfer.

Tyholt

   Tyholt may be the most visible of NTNU's campuses, simply because of the colourful 120-metre high telecommunications tower that can be seen from throughout the city. NTNU's buildings at Tyholt
   may be somewhat less colourful than the tower, but they are every bit as impressive, for it's here that you'll find the Department of Marine Technology, right next to the Ship Model Tank,
   Cavitation Tunnel and the Ocean Basin Laboratory. The ocean research facilities are technically owned by MARINTEK, a branch of SINTEF, but are used widely in NTNU research. The Marine
   Technology Library, which is also shared between NTNU and MARINTEK, is also located here, as is a SiT cafeteria.

Illustrasjonsbilde/FOTO Kalvskinnet and downtown

   Kalvskinnet, on the southern fringe of Trondheim's downtown, is home to the university's Museum of Natural History and Archaeology, as well as the Gunnerus Library, Norway's oldest scientific
   library. The library focuses on archaeology, botany, and zoology, but contains other natural science-related books. SiT has a Tapir bookstore and a cafeteria here as well.

   Down on the waterfront you'll find NTNU's own Sealab, or more formally, the NTNU Centre of Fisheries and Aquaculture, a shared research facility right in downtown Trondheim. Four of NTNU's
   seven faculties have research programmes here. SINTEF's Institutes of Fisheries and Aquaculture, Materials and Chemistry and Marine Environmental Technology also have representatives here too.

Øya

   Øya, a little peninsula just outside of downtown Trondheim created by the wanderings of the Nidelva River, is where you'll find St Olavs Hospital, the main tertiary care hospital in mid-Norway.
   Not surprisingly, NTNU's Department of Medicine is located here, with a host of research facilities, including the Kavli Centre for Systems Neuroscience/Centre for the Biology of Memory . SiT
   operates three cafeterias throughout the campus.

Olavskvartalet, Møllenberg and Brattøra

   Olavskvartalet features Trondheim's own concert hall, Olavshallen, where the Trondheim Symphony Orchestra regularly performs, and where NTNU's Department of Music has its music performance
   studies and music technology programmes. The Trondheim Academy of Fine Art is located across the Nidelva River from Olavshallen, in a fine building that also houses the academy's gallery.

Farther afield - other research facilities

   NTNU also has a number of far-flung research facilities, including the Ringve Botanical Garden, next to the Ringve Music Museum in Lade, the Department of Biology's Trondheim Biological
   Station, right on Trondheim fjord to the west of the city itself, and the Kongsvoll Biological Station, nearly three hours by car to the south, on the fringe of Dovrefjell National Park. Across
   from the biological station you'll find
