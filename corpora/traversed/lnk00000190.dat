Norwegian language courses at NTNU

   Living in Norway gives you an unparalleled opportunity to learn Norwegian. NTNU offers both full-time and part-time classes to help you learn Norwegian as a second language.

   Dragvoll Campus at NTNU Our full-time programme is called IFUS and admits 20 students each autumn. The programme is primarily intended for students who come directly from abroad, and who plan
   to go on to regular studies at NTNU that are taught in Norwegian.
   Our part-time programme, called Norwegian for Foreigners (or Norwegian as a second language) admits about 180 students each semester. It is comprised of courses at four different levels.
   Successful completion of level 3 fulfils the Norwegian language requirement for admission to NTNU and most studies at other universities and colleges. We also offer an intensive course in late
   summer for exchange students.

   Check our chart to see which course works for you:
