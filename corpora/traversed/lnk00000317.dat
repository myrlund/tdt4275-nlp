NTNU Nanolab

   NTNU NanoLab is in the process of establishing laboratories with state-of-the-art infrastructure, open for all researchers at the university interested in nanotechnological research. The
   laboratories for synthesis, structuring and characterization will be located in the close vicinity to each other. It is hoped that this will contribute to a strengthening of the
   cross-disciplinary approach to nanotechnology.
