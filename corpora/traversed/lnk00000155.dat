Self-financing

   Students who will either pursue an undergraduate degree or an International Master's Programme at NTNU and who are not eligible for a fellowship or scholarship programme, are welcome at NTNU
   provided they can pay their living expenses. Please note, there are no tuition fees at NTNU!

   Minimum funding requirements
   Regulations from the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration state that all international students who are not citizens of EU/EEA/EFTA countries need to apply for a residence permit for students
   (www.udi.no). This means that applicants for undergraduate or international master's programmes at NTNU under the Individual funding category must document their funding source(s)
   (NOK 92,500 for 2012/2013) in their application. Even though an international master's programme has a duration of two years, applicants only need to document funding for one year in their
   application.

   How to provide documentation
   In your application for admission to an international master's programme, you may document financing by means of a bank statement and a letter of confirmation from your sponsor, but The
   Norwegian Directorate of Immigration will only accept confirmation of scholarships or grants or bank guarantees from a Norwegian bank.

   Students in the "individual funding category" who are admitted to an international master's programme will be requested to transfer NOK 92,500 (2012/2013) to NTNU's deposit account before their
   arrival in Norway. This deposit is for covering life expences only (NTNU does not have tuition fees). The money will be transferred to the student's Norwegian bank account once the student has
   opened one. Information about the practical arrangements for transferring the money to the Norwegian bank account will be provided along with the admissions letter.
