Exchange students

   Illustrasjonsbilde/FOTO

    Want to study abroad? NTNU has nearly 300 different cooperative or exchange agreements with institutions in 58 countries, from Albania to Zimbabwe. The university also participates in numerous
   student exchange and placement programmes, such as the Erasmus programme and the Leonardo da Vinci programme. Others are operated in conjunction with other Nordic countries (NORDPLUS).

   Exchange students who come to NTNU from abroad typically attend the university for short periods of between 3-12 months and return to their home university at the end of the exchange period.

   If your university does not have a formal exchange agreement with NTNU, you may apply to study at NTNU for a maximum of one academic year as a Free Mover.

   If you're an NTNU student who wants to study abroad, contact the Office of International Relations. If you're an exchange student from abroad who is thinking about attending or is actually here
   at NTNU, here's what you need to know about:
