NTNU's Grading and Credit System

   NTNU uses the letter grading system for all examinations and most assessments.

   Grade

   Description

   General, qualitative description of the evaluation criteria

   A

   Excellent
   An excellent performance, clearly outstanding. The candidate demonstrates excellent judgement and a high degree of independent thinking.

   B

   Very good
   A very good performance. The candidate demonstrates sound judgement and a very good degree of independent thinking.

   C

   Good
   A good performance in most areas. The candidate demonstrates a reasonable degree of judgement and independent thinking in the most important areas.

   D

   Satisfactory
   A satisfactory performance, but with significant shortcomings. The candidate demonstrates a limited degree of judgement and independent thinking.

   E

   Sufficient
   A performance that meets the minimum criteria, but no more. The candidate demonstrates a very limited degree of judgement and independent thinking.

   F

   Fail
   A performance that does not meet the minimum academic criteria. The candidate demonstrates an absence of both judgement and independent thinking.

   The grade of Passed/Failed may be used in some assessments. Compulsory assignments that are not subject to any evaluation (for example, field work) are assessed by the grade of Completed/Not
   completed.

   Credit system
   The credit system now used at NTNU is based upon a workload of 60 credits for each academic year. This corresponds to European Credit Transfer System credits (ECTS).
