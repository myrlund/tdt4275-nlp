Joint Nordic Master's Programmes

   Joint Nordic Master's Programmes are two-year programmes that give students the opportunity to study at two different partner universities in the Nordic countries.
   Students will be able to choose between a number of universities for each MSc programme, which provides a unique possibility to tailor a degree by academic interest and area of specialization.
   Graduates will receive a joint or double degree at the completion of the programme. The language of instruction is English.
