International Schools in Trondheim

   Trondheim has two English-language international schools for children up to and including grade 10.

   For a city of its size, Trondheim offers a good variety of schooling alternatives for Norwegians and non-Norwegians alike. There are two English-language international schools: Birralee, which
   offers schooling based on the British National Curriculum, or the Trondheim International School, which is certified as an International Baccalaureate school for grades 1-10. At the moment, the
   Norwegian government subsidizes alternative schooling programmes such as international schools, so that the fees they charge are relatively low, typically around NOK 2000 per month.

   Parents can also choose a Steiner (Waldorf) School (in Norwegian), but the language of instruction there is Norwegian.

   You can also send your school-aged children to the Trondheim school system, where they'll be integrated into the local school classroom and offered special tutoring in Norwegian. Broadly
   speaking, the Norwegian school system is governed by a national curriculum; note that one surprise for some non-Norwegians is that Christian knowledge and religious and ethical education are a
   required part of schooling.

   Typically, the city of Trondheim also provides children of non-native residents language tutoring in the student's native language. Contact the principal of your school for more information
   about this.
