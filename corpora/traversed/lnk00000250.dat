Guidelines for Agreement Concerning Master's degree

   Guidelines for the Agreement Between Student and Home Department Concerning the Master's Degree - rights and duties

   1. The Master's programme agreement is a part of the student's individual education plan. The agreement is a binding contract regarding co-operation between the student, his/her academic
   supervisor and the Department, and it specifies the rights and duties that acceptance on to the Master's programme carries with it.

   2. Students who are admitted to a Master's programme are obliged to sign their Master's agreement and confirm their electronically based individual education plan by the relevant deadline (15
   September for students admitted in the autumn semester and 15 February for students admitted in the spring semester). A student's right to academic supervision and a personal or shared space in
   the reading rooms at Dragvoll is dependent upon the student having signed the agreement, confirmed his or her individual education plan each semester, and having paid the semester fee.

   3. The student's progression in relation to the nominal length of study must be specified in the agreement, and confirmed in the student's individual education plan. The agreed progression of
   study is based on the nominal length of two years of full-time study (30 ECTS credits per semester/60 ECTS credits per year). However, it is possible to apply for permission to study part time
   (we refer to Study regulations at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, § 8). This means that it is possible to complete the course of study as a part-time student with a maximum
   of four years of study). The time frame is stated in the Master's programme agreement and in the individual education plan. Students who fail to complete their course of study within this time
   frame without valid reason (valid reasons include illness and approved leave of absence) will have their place in the Master's programme withdrawn (see Study regulations at the Norwegian
   University of Science and Education, § 4 no. 5).

   4. Students are obliged to demonstrate progression in relation to the nominal length of study, unless they have been granted the right to study part-time. Leave of absence and part-time study
   can be approved following an application from the student (we refer to Study regulations at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, § 7). A student wishing to make such an
   application should submit it to his/her Department.

   5. Students are entitled to a total of 80 hours of academic supervision during their work with a Master's thesis that counts 60 credits. If the thesis counts fewer than 60 credits the number of
   hours allocated to academic supervision will be reduced according to the number of credits awarded for the thesis. The number of hours allocated to academic supervision is not related to
   whether or not the student completes the Master's programme within the nominal period of study. The time frame includes individual supervision as well as preparatory - and supplementary work
   for the supervisor. The estimated ratio for individual supervision vs. preparatory - and supplementary work is 1:4.

   6. During the course of the academic supervision of the Master's thesis the supervisor is specifically responsible for:
     * giving advice regarding framing and delimitation of the topic and approach to the problem
     * discussing and assessing hypotheses and methods
     * providing advice regarding professional literature, sources/data, as well as required resources
     * discussing matters of style, language, format and structure etc.
     * discussing results and their interpretation
     * ensuring that s/he is updated on the student's progress vis-a-vis the appointed time frame and progress schedule.
     * providing the student with information about ethical guidelines in relation to the work on the Master's thesis.

   7. If the academic supervisor is absent for a longer period of time as a result of research leave, illness or travel, the Department is responsible for appointing a new supervisor on the
   student's request.

   8. The student is responsible for allotting time for supervision within the time frame of the Master's agreement.

   9. The student is obliged to keep the academic supervisor and the Department updated on his or her academic progress. If s/he for some reason is forced to discontinue the course of study for a
   period of one semester or longer, this must be agreed and approved by the Department in advance. Part-time studies and leave of absence must be noted on the agreement form if applicable.

   10. If relations between the student and the supervisor become problematic for either the student or the supervisor, one or both of the parties may ask to be released from the academic
   supervision agreement. The Department is obliged to appoint a new supervisor if such a request is made.

   11. The Master's programme agreement must be monitored each semester in order to ensure that any required adjustments and changes to the agreement are made.

   12. In cases where the student submits a new thesis (if the primary thesis is not given a pass grade, see Study regulations at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, § 31), the
   student is obliged to enter into a new agreement with the Department, and this must be based on those changes and improvements to the thesis that are planned and approved.
