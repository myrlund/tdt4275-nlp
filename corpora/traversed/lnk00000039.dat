Admission requirements

   The admissions process is determined by the degree you choose to pursue and its associated language requirements.

   If you meet the Norwegian language requirements, or have a related Scandinavian language as your mother tongue, you can apply to any of NTNU's degree programmes, but you also must demonstrate
   that you meet the English language requirements.

   If you do not meet the Norwegian language requirements and want to study for a degree offered only in Norwegian, you can meet the proficiency requirements by studying Norwegian full-time with
   the IFUS Programme. You can also take the Bergen test to prove your proficiency. NTNU offers different short-term or part-time Norwegian courses, an intensive month-long class in the summer, as
   well as semester-long classes, which can help you prepare for the Bergen test. Successful completion of three semesters of Norwegian taught at NTNU is considered to be the equivalent of passing
   the Bergen test.

   If you wish to study for a degree taught in English, but English is not your native language, you must meet the English language requirements.

   A summary of all language requirements is available in a booket entitled "Study at NTNU" (pdf).
