It started with one computer...

   Fifty years ago, GIER, a coat-closet sized computer, came to Trondheim. It ushered the university into the digital age. In celebration of that singular event, the Faculty of Information
   Technology, Mathematics and Electrical Engineering has made a video that gives you an overview of just what GIER brought to Trondheim.

   Climate events can drive high-arctic population dynamics
   (17.01.2013) Climate change is known to affect the population dynamics of single species, such as reindeer or caribou, but the effect of climate at the community level has been much more
   difficult to document. Now, a group of researchers led by scientists from NTNU's Centre for Conservation Biology have documented this effect, as reported in the 18 Jan. 2013 issue of Science.

   NTNU professor named to Nature's list of top commentators
   (02.01.2013) Your morning cup of coffee just might be contributing to species extinction, says Edgar Hertwich, director of NTNU's Industrial Ecology Programme, in a commentary for Nature
   magazine. His pointed commentary won the professor a place as one of the publication's top commentaries for 2012.
