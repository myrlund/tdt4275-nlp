   International Master's Programmes

Admissions requirements

   NTNU offers more than 30 international master's programmes.

   Admission is dependent upon:

     * Excellent academic performance
     * Documentation of proficiency in English according to our requirements.

   Who can apply
   All our international master's programmes have a duration of 2 academic years (4 semesters) and are mainly intended for international students. Some students are self-funded (see also Nordic
   Masters' Programme), while other students are admitted with funding from Norway's Quota Scheme.You are also welcome to apply if you have a relevant first degree from Norway or another Nordic
