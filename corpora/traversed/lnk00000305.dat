Visas and work/residence permits

   Apply for a visa via Application Portal Norway if you can.
   The Directorate for Immigration (UDI) is moving to an online application process, although it will still be necessary to bring supporting documents to a consulate or embassy. You can find the
   Application Portal online along with an interactive web page that enables you to determine if your circumstances will allow you to make your preliminary application on line.

   You can also check out the Trondheim Immigration Office's Facebook page.

   But... do you need a visa?
   All international students, visiting researchers and newly hired employees who are going to stay in Norway for more than 3 months must have a valid residence/work permit. The requirements may
   be slightly different for students depending upon your home country, your location when you apply for a permit and your source of funding. You can find a detailed description of the
   requirements for students on the UDI web page.

   If you are a resident of the EU/EFTA/EEA you have the right to live and work in Norway for up to three months, but you must register yourself with the police.

   Applications for most permits can be done via the Application Portal Norway, as above, but you will need to submit supporting documents to the appropriate embassy.

   Note that if you plan to bring your family with you to Norway, you will all need to go together at some point to show officials your family -- the Immigration officials will want to physically
   see your children.

   Renewing your residence/work permit
   It is possible to renew your permit with an application via Application Portal Norway.  Renewals should be submitted at least one month before the current permit expires, or even earlier if you
   need your passport for travel.

   You can visit the UDI website to read more about applying for and renewing your work permit from Norway.

   Processing times can be long
   Once submitted, processing times for work permits can vary anywhere from 1-4 months. A letter confirming you have been granted a work/residence permit will be sent in the mail.

   Application forms and what you need to apply
   The application forms for Non EU/ EEA countries are different than those for applicants from EU/EEA countries, and are different for individuals who are coming with a family or alone. While we
   have tried to summarize what you need below, there are so many small details that the best idea is to go directly to the UDI website for visa applications.

   In general, you will need to have:
   *Job offer (with Salary) / Letter of admission from the Office of International Relations
   * Passport (Must be valid for the duration of your stay in Norway)
   * Passport size photo
   * Letter from Consulate that issued your visa (in English)
   * Payment (see fees below).

   Fees
   Fees vary depending on which country you come from.The UDI website has a complete listing of different visa/permit fees. Note that it is not always possible to use foreign credit cards for
   payment at the UDI so be prepared to use cash.

   Insurance and health check requirements vary
   EU/EEA Students must also bring a proof of health insurance that is valid for the entire length of study in Norway. This can be proof of private insurance, an E-form, or the European Health
   Insurance Card.

   Students from specific countries may also have to have a tuberculosis examination. You can request more information about the health check at the Immigration Department.

   Where to go, appointments
   The Immigration Office is co-located with the Trondheim Police Station and is found at Gryta 4, 7010 Trondheim (just east of the railway station. Remember to check their Facebook page to see if
   there are changes in opening times or other useful information. You must have an appointment, which you get in one of three ways:
     * If you apply online for the visas and permits you need at the Application Portal Norway you will then be given a time to come to the Trondheim Police Station to present documents or pick
       them up, depending on where you are in the permitting process.
     * If you do not have access to the Internet, you can stop by the Immigration Office, Counter D, between 9:00 and 11:00 Mondays through Thursdays to get an appointment.
     * Information and appointment times are also available by telephone at 73 89 94 40, but this number is only staffed on Mondays through Thursdays from 0900-1130, and the number is often busy.
