   Bokforside When the British Labour party announced the withdrawal of British forces from the Persian Gulf in January 1968, the United States faced a potential power vacuum in the area. The
   incoming Nixon administration, preoccupied with the Soviet Union and China, and the war in Vietnam, had no intention of replacing the British in the Gulf. To avoid further military commitments,
   the US encouraged Iran and Saudi Arabia to maintain area security. A critical policy decision, overlooked by most scholars, saw Nixon and Kissinger engineer the rise in oil prices between 1969
   and 1972 to enable Saudi Arabia and Iran to purchase the necessary military hardware to serve as guardians of the Gulf. For all their bluster about reversing Labour's withdrawal decision, after
   their surprise victory in the election of June 1970 the Conservatives adhered to Labour's policy. But in contrast to Labour's wish to cut the umbilical cord of empire, the Tories wanted to
   retain influence in the Persian Gulf, pursuing policies largely independent of the US by the creation of the United Arab Emirates, deposing the sultan of Oman, and trying to solve the dispute
   over the Buraimi oasis with Saudi Arabia. By trying to maintain its empire on the cheap, Britain turned into an arms supplier supreme. But offering and selling arms does not make a foreign
   policy, leaving Britain in the long run with less influence in regional affairs. This was true also for the US, whose arms sales were to prove no realistic an alternative to foreign policy.The
   US hid under the Iranian security blanket for almost a decade. Given the weakness of the regime and the Shah's nonsensical dreams of turning Iran into one of the top five industrial and
   military powers in the world, the policy was cavalierly irresponsible. Similarly, leaving Saudi Arabia wallowing in oil money and medieval stupor - a seedbed for Islamic fundamentalists -
   created major future problems for the United States, as evinced by 9/11.

   Bokforside
   Taking as a point of departure the seemingly naïve question How big is a thing?, Wyller argues that the particular size of spatially extended objects can neither be an intrinsic property of
   objects nor a relation between physical objects. Similar to the particular duration of events, the size of spatially extended objects is accessible only to embodied subjects. Consequently,
   determinate extension in space and time is essentially indexical, inconceivable in a world without human beings.

   Sigurd Bergmann, Heather Eaton (eds.): Ecological Awareness Exploring Religion, Ethics and Aesthetics. LIT Verlag 2011

   ________________________________________________
   Bokforside The past years have seen an ecological development in religions that is staggering. These efforts are responses to difficult local and global ecological problems, with an increased
   awareness that religions need to be alert, engaged and active partners in the work for a sustainable future.
   Ecological Awareness - with 17 authors from theology, religious studies, biology, sociology and philosophy - explores how religious practitioners have become increasingly aware of ecological
   challenges. The book considers aspects of ecological awareness: personal, social, political, religious and ecological. It sheds new light on an essential function of belief systems, which
   function not only as cognitive and moral systems, but emerge from and affect our human body and its mode of perceiving our milieu and ourselves within it. The book contributes to an increasing
   awareness of our embeddedness in larger life processes, as well as the awareness of life as a gift.
