Student Housing at Persaunet

   Persaunet Student Housing (PSH) is an old nursing home within walking distance from campus Gløshaugen and Tyholt (NTNU). Approximately 160 exchange students from Europe, staying for the fall
   semester, will be living at PSH. (PSH will not be open during the spring semester). The students given such an offer will be contacted by e-mail in June/July.
   During the first few weeks of the semester, there will be a reception at PSH where you can pick up your key. For this period the reception will be open 24 hours a day, so you can just show up
   at PSH whenever arriving.


   There is a bus stop close to the complex with a direct route to campus Dragvoll and the city center. Click here to search and read more about bus routes in Trondheim.
   The adress is Persaunvegen 54, 7046 Trondheim, click here to see the location at the map.
   Approximately 160 students was living at Persaunet for the fall semester 2011. Hopefully PSH will also be available for exchange/visiting students staying for one semester fall 2012 as well.
   As a resident at PSH, you will share your bed room with 1-3 students, depending on the size of the rooms. Each floor will have its own resident representative. These will have a single room to
   compensate for the responsibility and workload. All rooms will be furnished with beds, closets and small desks. There is also a sink in almost every room. The rooms have been equipped to suit
   the demands for student housing.

   You will have common areas such as study rooms, living rooms, shared kitchens and bathrooms. The kitchens will be equipped with necessary articles and equipment for preparing basic meals, but
   if you have special wishes for more advanced equipment, you should bring or buy this yourself. You will also have access to a laundry at Moholt Student Village.

   There will be a wireless internet connection at PSH. This will be free of charge. Due to solid concrete walls there might not be a signal everywhere in the building, but it will at least be
   accessible in the living- and study rooms.

    If you arrive in Trondheim before PSH opens, you'll have to find another place to live in the meantime, i.e. the Interrail Center (http://tirc.no/).

   "Roof over your head" will use a part of the building for their purpose in the first period of the semester. They will have their own bathrooms and common areas and be separated from your
   residences, but you should prepare for a busy time at PSH in this period!

   There is a grocery store (ICA) about 700 meters from PSH. This grocery store also hosts a post office, and you will be able to withdraw cash when buying something with a VISA-card.

   When staying at PSH you will be required to follow certain rules regarding cleaning, noise level etc. These rules will be communicated to the residents when moving in.
