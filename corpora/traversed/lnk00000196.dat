Intensive Norwegian Summer Courses for Exchange Students

- Summer 2012

   They are fun and challenging, and a way to make new friends and learn about a new culture: NTNU's intensive summer Norwegian courses are a great opportunity for exchange students who want to
   learn Norwegian.

   We offer two different course periods:
     * Course A:  Thursday, 26.7.2012 - 18.8.2012
     * Course B:  Monday, 30.7.2012 - 18.8.2012

   Both courses are organized by NTNU's Office of International Relations, and supported by the European Commission under the framework of the EILC programme. This means that you may only apply
   for EILC scholarships if you are a participant in the Erasmus programme. You should be able to obtain the necessary application forms from the International Office at your university. To be
   registered as an EILC applicant we must receive the electronic application form (see below), plus the EILC application form from your home institution. As an EILC applicant both document has to
   be sent in before the deadline.
   Students not applying for the EILC programme need only to send the print of the electronic application form.

   We welcome 180 students from all over the world with majority from EU countries. Please note that we cannot guarantee a place in the language course due to the large number of applicants. You
   will be notified about the results approximately one week after the registration deadline.

   NORWEGIAN - THE REAL EUROPEAN CHALLANGE:
   NTNU has a long tradition with exchange students following international master courses or doing their thesis work supervised by English-speaking professors. But to get most out of a stay in
   Norway, you have to learn the language. The summer intensive course is exactly what its name suggests --INTENSIVE -- and the pace is very fast.

   The programme
   The language course is comprised of a total of 70 hours of training. You also work with your fellow students in self-study groups on different language tasks. Because of the high-speed progress
   it is extremely important that the participants take part from the very beginning. It is not possible to work part-time jobs during the course!

   Difference between course A and B:
   Both courses have the same amount of teaching hours (70) and the lectures will start at the same day. But course A gives you more time to socialise with your future fellow students, to start
   the first weekend with an exciting hiking trip and other social activities. It might also be easier to get cheaper tickets when you can avoid weekend arrivals.

   Our enthusiastic language team encourages you to participate in cultural and social events in Trondheim and our main focus is on out door activities. A small fee for the social programme
   enables you to learn more about your new study country.

   Course level/difficulty
   We offer 9 different groups. Each group has a maximum of about 20 students. In general courses start at the beginners level.  Two courses are reserved for students with some knowledge.

   Social programme
   The Office of International Relations offers a social programme, which includes "get-to-know" Trondheim activities, various dinners/barbecues, weekend and day trips in the surroundings of
   Trondheim and, of course, a lot of fun. Some of the activities can be challenging physically and will definitely need appropriate clothing and equipment.. The social programme is an integral
   part of the language course.

   Course fees
