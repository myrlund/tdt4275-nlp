   Examination candidates are to be in the examination hall no later than 10 minutes before examination starts. A valid semester card and ID document with photo are to be brought to the
   examination hall. These are shown before signing the attendance list.

Re-sit examinations

   Re-sit examinations will be held in weeks 32-33. The deadline for registration for examination is 9 July. Information about which groups of students are allowed to take the re-sit examination
   will be available from mid June. The plan for examinations will be available from the middle of July. Students wishing to take a re-sit examination must make the registration themselves on

Re-examinations

   If the student has passed, he/she only has the right to re-take an examination once more in each course in order to improve his/her grade. If the student is registered for an examination and
   has not withdrawn his/her examination registration by the deadline decided by the Director of the Student and Academic Division, this is regarded as one attempt. The highest grade obtained is
   the one that counts. When the grade for a course is based on two or more assessments or tests, all of these have to be re-taken.
