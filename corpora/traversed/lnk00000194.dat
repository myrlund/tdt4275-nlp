IFUS - Application process for students residing abroad

   If you want to apply for the Introductory Program in the Norwegian Language (IFUS), you must use the preliminary application form . The application form will be online in the end of October.The
   deadline for applying is December 1st for admission in the following year.

   STEP 1: Complete PRELIMINARY application form
   1. Do not submit any documentation with your preliminary application. Since the program is highly competitive, it is important to fill in all sections of the form. Failure to give details about
   how you will finance your studies or the study programme you would like to pursue after IFUS will result in rejection.

   2. Await a written response from the initial screening (Dec. /Jan.).

   The screening process generally takes place in late December. Final application forms are sent out in December/January to qualified candidates. All incomplete applications or unqualified
   applicants will receive a standard rejection letter giving the main reasons for the rejection.

   3. Make arrangements, if necessary, to take the TOEFL test or the IELTS test or equivalent. Most applicants have to take this test to document English proficiency. The only exemptions are
   listed here

   STEP 2: Complete FINAL application
   1. The application deadline for the final application form is February 15th .

   2. The application should include at least three alternative choices of study.

   3. Certified copies of transcripts and diplomas starting with secondary school, should be included.

   4. The application should also include documented proof of funding.

   5. Proof of sufficient knowledge of English is required, preferably by taking the TOEFL or IELTS test. Note that the result of the TOEFL test has to be sent directly from ETS or British Council
   to the Office of International Relations in order to be accepted.

   STEP 3: Await result
   1. ACCEPTANCE LETTER: The best candidates for the IFUS program are selected and sent a letter of admission, usually at the end of April, beginning of May.

   2. WAITING LIST: Other highly qualified candidates will be put on the waiting list and notified in the case of a vacancy.

   3. UNQUALIFIED APPLICANTS: Applicants with grades or education that are insufficient for admission into the program of their choice or those who did not submit all the necessary information
   receive a rejection letter.

   STEP 4: Apply for residence permit
   Accepted candidates must apply for their residence permit through the Norwegian embassy or consulate in their home country. The coordinator at NTNU's Office of International Relations will
   supply the Norwegian immigration authorities with the names of all selected candidates to the IFUS program, and keep in contact with the immigration authorities to ensure that all the
   candidates receive their residence permits in time.

   NOTE: Students coming from countries that require visa for entry, cannot enter Norway until AFTER they have received their residence permit.

   STEP 5: Orientation
   SEMESTER START

   The semester usually begins between the 16th and 20th of August. It is crucial that the students arrive before lectures begin. Students who arrive more than two weeks after the semester starts
   usually lose their place in the program.

   ORIENTATION WEEK

   The Office of International Relations arranges an orientation week for all new international students in the Fall semester. This usually takes place the week before lectures begin. We strongly
   recommend that you participate in this week. It gives a lot of important and necessary information as well as an opportunity to meet other international students before the semester begins.

Application

   The preliminary application form can be downloaded from the following web page:
     * Preliminary Application - IFUS

   New application material is made available in late October each year and the preliminary application form is only made available online. Make sure that you fill in all the necessary information
   before you click on the send icon. Note that it is no longer necessary to send a hard copy of the preliminary application form.

   Please, submit only one application. We will only process one application per person. Applicants with more than one application, will only have their last submitted application considered.

   Note: Submissions made on application forms from previous years are NOT processed. If you want your application processed you must use the current application form.

   The final application form is only sent to the qualified applicants from the preliminary application process. It is therefore not available online.
