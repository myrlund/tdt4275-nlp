IFUS admission requirements

   General Requirements
   IFUS minimum admission requirements vary depending upon your home country and native language. NTNU follows the national guidelines offered by the GSU-list.

   You must also fulfil the university's English language requirements. If you come from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, or Vietnam and have a BA/BSc/BEng degree where
   English was the language of instruction, you still must prove that you meet the English language requirements (unless you received a BA degree in English).

   If you meet these minimum entrance requirements, and can document sufficient funding, we will evaluate you for admission to the programmes you would like to attend after IFUS. You will be
   competing for a spot with other applicants to the programmes of your choice, so a competitive grade point average is a great advantage. Once you have completed the IFUS programme, your
   conditional acceptance status will be converted to regular admission.

   Financial requirements
   As an applicant to IFUS, you have to document that you have enough money to support yourself during your studies in Norway. The immigration authorities currently require a minimum of NOK 89 000
   per year for each year of study.

   Individual education plan requirement
   You must also identify at least three alternative choices for your post-IFUS studies. The Office of International Relations will make every effort to grant you your first choice. Remember,
   though, we have to compare your qualifications with the requirements for the individual courses, and you must also compete with Norwegian applicants for places in courses with restricted
   admissions. If we can't offer you a place in any of the study alternatives you chose, then we will have to reject your application to the IFUS programme as well.

   Additionally, you cannot apply to International Masters programmes, medicine or the professional studies in psychology, music and fine arts through the IFUS program.
