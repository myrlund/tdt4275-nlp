Using the Studentweb

   All exchange students and free movers now have access to the Studentweb. The Studentweb is used for multiple purposes:
     * Registering for courses
     * Registering for exams. Deadlines: 15 September/15 February
     * Viewing exam results and ordering transcripts of records
     * Registering your address in Trondheim

   For additional information and user guidelines, click HERE .

   To access Studentweb, log on using the link on the website https://studentweb.ntnu.no

   Input your username and password. The username and password is given to you when you register at the Oracle service (see the Checklist for details).


Registering for courses

   All students must register for the courses they are going to attend. Registering for a course will give you access to the course information, assignments etc. available through It's Learning,
   NTNU's net-based e-learning platform. (See the Checklist for information about It's Learning)

   Please keep in mind:
     * You should not register for more than 30 ECTS credits per semester.
     * You must register for courses before you register for the exams.



Registering for exams


   After registering for a course, you must register for the exams in that course.

   Please remember to:
     * register for courses even if there is no written examination.
     * check the exam schedule to make sure that the courses you register for do not have an exam on the same day.
     * check the course schedule to avoid selecting courses that are taught at the same time.

   Please note that registering for courses and exams is compulsory, even if you have been pre-approved for your courses before arriving in Trondheim.



Procedures


   You can register for courses and exams in all courses that you have been preapproved for. If, however, you have to change your plan of study, please follow this procedure:

   1. Check that you fulfill the requirements for the given course.
   It is YOUR responsibility to check that you have the necessary academic background for the courses you register for. Before registering a course that you have not been preapproved for, read the
   information about the prerequisites (required previous knowledge) for that course. This information is available on: http://www.ntnu.no/studies/courses

   If you are in doubt as to whether or not you fulfill the requirements, or if you need advice, please check the list for contact persons at the Faculties/Departments (UPDATED LIST WILL BE
   AVAILABLE SOON!). These contact persons can assist you if you have questions regarding your academic qualifications.

   LIST OF CONTACT PERSONS - Click HERE (pdf).

   2. If you have all the necessary prerequisites then log on to Studentweb and register for the exam.



Restricted admission


   NOTE: In some cases, registration for a course/exam is not possible due to the fact that some courses have restricted admission. If you are unable to register for a course due to restricted
   admission, please contact the Office of International Relations for assistance.
     * Courses with restricted admission

   When registering for courses that you have been preapproved for you may experience that you are unable to register due to restricted admission. In order to have these courses registered, you
   must hand in the form "Approval of additional courses with restricted admission"

   Instructions for filling in the form:
     * If you have been preapproved for a restricted admission course, the approval/signature from the Faculty is not needed, only the course code and course title.
     * If you have not been preapproved, but you wish to add a restricted admission course to your plan of study, the Faculty or Department in charge of the course must approve your taking the
       course (ie sign the form). In order to get the signatures you need, please contact the departmental/faculty contact .
     * After you have completed the form bring the form to the Office of International Relations so that we can register you for the restricted admission classes and exams listed on the form.

   NOTE: If you are NOT registering for any restricted admission courses you do NOT need to submit the restricted course admission approval form.



Exam results and transcripts of records


     * You may view your exam results and order copies of your transcript of grades using the Studentweb . Click "status" and then "view exam results" to see the exams that have been graded at
       NTNU.
     * Click "orders" and then "examination transcripts" to have a transcript sent to your address as soon as the results are available. There is no charge for this service. Please note that most
       exam results are available sometime in January for the fall exams and sometime in July for the spring exams.
       Remember that if your home address has changed since you submitted your application to NTNU you will need to tell the Office of International Relations your new address so that we can
       update the information. Please email us: international@adm.ntnu.no and write ADDRESS CHANGE in the subject line of the email.
