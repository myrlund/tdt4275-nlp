   The Bachelor's degree in Philosophy comprises compulsory courses, which trace the history of Philosophy from ancient to modern times, introduce central themes and philosophers of Twentieth
   Century Philosophy and provide grounding in the logico-linguistic methods of contemporary analytical Philosophy and Philosophy of science. Students then take specialization courses, which at
   present are organised around three main topics or 'profiles': Ethics and Political Philosophy; Aesthetics, and Theoretical philosophy (some topics are: Metaphysics, Theory of knowledge and
   philosophy of science). In addition, the Department offers courses in other areas of Philosophy, which, together with a flexible curriculum, allows for a different or more general
   specialization profile. Our specialization courses can also be taken as part of a Bachelor's (or even Master's) degree with a main subject area other than Philosophy.

   The Master's degree is a two-year full-time study awarding 120 ECTS credits. The programme focuses on meta-theoretical and methodological aspects of Philosophy before the student embarks on
   supervised work culminating in the Master's thesis. Master's/Postgraduate students are also encouraged to make use of the specialization courses offered, in their areas of interest (see above).

   The Department is also responsible for the Introductory course in Philosophy. It is a compulsory introductory course for all students at Norwegian universities. Furthermore, the Department
   offers teaching in connection with the course Introduction to Neuroscience at the Faculty of Medicine and a Theory of Science course for PhD students at the Faculty of Humanities.

   Programmes of study:
     * Bachelor of Philosophy
     * Master of Philosophy
     * Master of Applied Ethics (Erasmus Mundus)
     * Examen philosophicum (In Norwegian)
