Housing

   Please be aware that the information in this webpage can change, so check back often for updates.

   The Office of International Relations at NTNU is responsible for allocating accommodation for international students. All international students who have applied for an exchange period at NTNU
   will receive information about housing from the Office of International Relations before their arrival.
   Once you applied for an exchange period at NTNU before the deadline, you automatically applied for housing (unless you specified in the form that you will arrange for housing on your own). You
   should not, under any circumstances, contact SiT about housing before you have received information from The Office of International Relations.

   Unfortunately, NTNU cannot guarantee housing for all incoming exchange students. Accepted exchange students from countries outside of the EU/EEA are guaranteed housing due to visa regulations.
   All students who have applied for studies at NTNU in the fall semester will be informed about housing in time before their arrival (second half of June).

   Students who have applied within the deadline ( May 1^st for the fall semester / October 1^st for the spring semester) and have been accepted, will be prioritized for housing. This does not
   mean, however, that you are guaranteed housing. If you for some reason applied after the deadline you will therefore not be prioritized for housing since students who applied before the
   deadline will be first in line when the rooms are being allocated. This means that if there are vacant rooms at the student village after we have allocated available rooms we may however give
   you a room. But be aware that this is not very likely.
   Due to the fact that we have a lot of exchange students at NTNU and not enough rooms available at the student villages, the Office of International Relations cannot allocate housing for PhD's.
   However, PhD's from the Quota programme and HEC-students financed by SiU are exempted from this rule. Otherwise, though, in general if you are a PhD student, you are considered an NTNU
   employee, and there are different programmes to help you with housing which you can read about here.
   The Students Welfare Organization, SiT, is a non-profit organization led by the students through their majority in the board. The rules require that up to 30% of the rooms in the student
   villages are allocated to international students, but not more. NTNU has to adhere to this rule and so has to prioritize who will get student housing.
   Priority will be given to students coming from partner universities where NTNU has an exchange agreement (this does not mean however that all students from partner institutions will be
   allocated housing). We will also give the priority a certain geographical profile.
   Students who are not provided housing by SiT has to find private housing on their own. (It is usually easier to find housing in the spring semester, both at the student village and in
   Trondheim's private housing market.)
   Students who have to find private housing may find more information in this webpage http://www.ntnu.edu/studies/searching-for-private-housing

   Students who are lucky and are allocated housing at SiT or Persaunet by the Office of International Relations will find important information on these webpages.
