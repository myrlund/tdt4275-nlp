Step-by-Step Survival Guide

   Remember NTNU offers a wide range of courses taught in English from which visiting and exchange students can choose. The list includes courses from all faculties and covers a broad spectrum of
   disciplines. Use the links under "COURSE INFORMATION" to find out more.

1. Make a list of your courses

   WHICH COURSES? Make a list of the course codes for courses you listed on your application and which you were approved for.
   For example:
   TDT4230 Visualization
   POL1003 Environmental Politics
     * EU (European Union) exchange students who do not remember which courses they registered for may check their original application on-line . See the link on the the bottom of the page with
       the heading STATUS OF YOUR APPLICATION, ie: Your study programme- click here.
     * Exchange students/free-movers from outside the EU who do not remember which courses they registered for should contact the Office of International Relations . (Please check the information
       previously sent to you first. You should have a list.)
     * If you want to take a course for which you were not previously approved there are two ways to obtain approval. The way you do it depends on whether or not the course is restricted admission
       or open admission.
       Restricted admission: Contact the department/faculty for approval and have them sign the restricted course approval form. A list of contacts is provided HERE(.pdf).
       NOTE: A list of courses which are restricted admission is provided HERE . You'll find a link to the overview over restricted admission courses on the right hand side of the web page, ie
       "Oversikt over adgangsbegrensede emner". Unfortunately this list is only available in Norwegian, but the course numbers are easy to understand so you can at least see if the course you have
       selected is restricted admission.
       Please click HERE for the approval form you will need to have signed by the faculty.
       Open admission: check to see that you have the prerequisites (academic background) for the course(s) you would like to add to your program and then register for the course using STUDWEB
       (see below).

   Course information:
     * The on-line catalog provides an English description of the courses being offered at NTNU. (Notice search options to the left!). Check the box "Show only courses offered in English" for
       courses offered in English.
     * The Norwegian on-line catalogs provide the most up-to-date information of what is offered. You will find the Norwegian catalogues quite useful even if you don't know a word of Norwegian.
     * If you are taking courses on graduate level you might also be interested in checking the catalog for the International Master's programs . Click HERE for the catalog.
     * Hard copies of the catalogues are available in the Main Library or International House (but they may not be taken home). They can also be purchased from the university bookstore run by SiT
       .


2. Check that you have the correct course code

   CORRECT COURSE CODE? Course codes sometimes change. To check if you have the correct code you should first check the English on-line catalog . If you don't find what you need there then check
   the Norwegian course catalogs. If you are having trouble, please ask at the faculty office or the Office of International Relations .

3. Find when and where the course is

   WHEN? To find out when and where the course is given (lecture times and location) please see the  course schedule (TIMEPLAN). The list is alphabetical by course code. Click on the course code
   for information on the time and place the course will be taught and who is teaching it.

   In some cases it may say:"Spørsmål om undervisning og timeplan rettes til instituttet som gir undervisning i emnet." Basically this means if you have questions about the course or the schedule
   go to the department offering the course and ask.

   In order to understand the course schedule (TIMEPLAN), you will need to know a few Norwegian terms:

     * Ask an academic advisor (pdf). Bring your transcript with you!

   I selected this course and it isn't being offered (or I decided I don't want to take it). What can I take?
     * Check the on-line English catalog and the on-line Norwegian catalogs
     * If you need some advice on what to take, ask an academic advisor (pdf).

   Still uncertain who to ask?
     * Ask the Office of International Relations .
