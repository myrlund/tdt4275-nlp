More detailed information on the courses

   SPRÅK1501 Academic Writing (7.5 ECTS Credits)
     * Academic writing is an integral part of an academic education.
     * The course is also presented at the departmental web pages.
     * The course will cover the basic structures of term papers and other types of academic writing, with focus on establishing the rationale and purpose of an academic paper.
     * Since academic writing is dependent on the research of others, the course will emphasize the importance of finding, evaluating and referring to relevant literature. Reference is a key issue
       here. In addition, the course will provide students with writing and language techniques that are useful in writing a clear, coherent, logical text.

     * The course focuses on the political and economic development of Norway from year 1000 to year 2000, from the Viking Age to the present day. The main emphasis is on the time period after
