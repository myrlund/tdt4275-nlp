PhD

   The PhD education programme has the objective of training candidates to be independent researchers who can work at an international level in cooperation with Norwegian and international
   research groups.

   The Faculty of Humanities hosts four PhD programmes:
     * PhD programme in Interdisciplinary Studies of Culture
     * PhD programme in Historical and Cultural Studies
     * PhD programme in Humanities and the Arts
     * PhD programme in Language and Linguistics

   Follow the links to read about each programme. Or you may find more information about the PhD education at NTNU here.

   Dr.philos.
   If you have not been admitted to any of the PhD programmes you may still apply for the opportunity to submit a thesis for evaluation for the degree of dr.philos. A Norwegian doctoral degree is
   awarded as proof that the candidate's research qualifications are of a certain standard. The same standards apply for the research qualifications for a dr.philos. degree as for a PhD degree.
   This principle of equivalence refers to the academic standard and quality of the work submitted, not merely its scope. Since the degree of dr. philos. does not include an organized research
   training programme, the preparatory work (e.g. the collection of data) and the thesis itself are expected to be more extensive than that required in degrees with an organized research training
   programme. When assessing a doctoral thesis, special consideration is given to whether the thesis is an independent and comprehensive piece of work of high academic standard with regard to the
   formulation of research questions, methodological, theoretical and empirical bases, documentation, treatment of the literature and form of presentation in the thesis.
   The thesis and an application should be handed in to the research section at the Faculty of Humanities. If you have exams and degrees from other institutions than NTNU, authorized copies of
   documentation must be enclosed. We advise that you get in touch with the relevant department before handing in your thesis. More information can be found in the regulations concerning the
   dr.philos. degree.
