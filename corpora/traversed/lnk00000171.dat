   Examinations at NTNU

Information about cheating and academic misconduct

   On 12 October 2006, the Board of NTNU passed Guidelines concerning the action to be taken in cases of students cheating or attempting to cheat at examinations at NTNU. This extract from these
   Guidelines is written to give students important information about this matter.NTNU regards cheating as a serious matter with grave consequences when a student is even suspected of cheating.
   Failing to respect the work of others by not citing sources can lead to an examination being failed and even expulsion from NTNU and all higher education in Norway for up to one year.

   NTNU defines cheating as actions that are in conflict with the examination regulations that lead to the results being more favourably judged than would otherwise be the case. This is a broad
   definition that includes gross negligence. The following examples clarify what NTNU can regard as cheating:
     * An examination answer paper with all or some of the text from the Internet that is presented as the student's own work
     * An examination answer paper with all or some of the text used by someone else at a previous examination
     * An examination answer paper with all or some of the text used by the student at a previous examination
     * An examination answer paper with all or some of the text written by someone else
     * Work that is handed in as the student's own work that is written, designed or composed by someone else
     * Quotes from textbooks, other sources, or the Internet that are not presented with their sources and are not clearly marked as quotations (plagiarism)
     * Using examination support material that is not permitted

   Ask your professors, Student Service or student advisers at NTNU if you are unsure about the rules relating to cheating. It is the student's own responsibility to find out about the rules
   relating to the use of other people's work - plagiarism - which is against Norwegian law (see below). In an examination, each student must find out what examination support material is
   permitted.

   Plagiarism detection
   NTNU has acquired a system for plagiarism detection. This system is designed to detect plagiarism in examination answer papers submitted in connection with teaching at NTNU. This means that
   texts submitted by students in courses at NTNU can be checked for plagiarism.


   What Norwegian law says about cheating

   The Act of 1 April 2005 relating to Universities and University Colleges Section 4-7, Subsection 1, b. states that the University Appeals Committee can annul an examination or test or approval
   of a course if the student has

   attempted to cheat or on purpose or with gross negligence has cheated in the course of or prior to the final assessment of the examination or test concerned, or while taking the course in
   question.

   Annulment of the examination (The above Law, Section 4-7, Subsection 1, b)
   The least severe reaction is annulment of the examination. Annulment alone is used in the least serious cases of cheating. An attempt to cheat includes gross negligence. The matter is decided
   by the University Appeals Committee.

   Suspension from further studies (The above Law, Section 4-8, Subsection 3)
   In the graver cases of cheating the student may be excluded from NTNU and may lose the right to take examinations at other institutions covered by the Act relating to Universities and
   University Colleges for a period of one year. The matters is decided by the University Appeals Committee and requires two-thirds majority, see Act of 1 April 2005 relating to Universities and
   University Colleges Section 4-8, Subsection 4.
