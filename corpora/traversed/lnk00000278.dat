The Towerblock post-mortem

- artbased research

   The Tower Block is the main building in the old central hospital in Trondheim. Now it is demolished as a new modern hospital is rising on its grounds. As a way of drawing attention to the
   disappearance of an emotional landmark in the city, we have created a project that explores the connection of the Tower block and the city of Trondheim, focusing on the memories that the site
   has generated in the people over time.

   The project is divided into three distinct stages:
     * First we have created a webpage that allows people gathering memories from the Tower block. At the web page www.hoyblokka.no the memories are presented as light in the windows of the Tower
       block. Some memories are written, some are told, and some are presented in various experimental ways, using the concepts of soundscapes, landscapes and handscapes.
     * These memories are the basis for the second stage, a memorial service for the Tower block held in january 2011. In the ruins of the Tower blokc, under its concrete skeleton a performance in
       the form of a multimedia ritual where light, sound and video projection called the Tower block to life for the last time.
     * Third, the Tower Block is a research project that explores the relations between art and research. We focus on topics such as the performative aspects of memories; the role of writing and
       technology in the manifestation of memory; the nature of place and emptiness in wakening the presence of things long gone; the relationship between emptyness and technology; and what can we
       learn about performance from a project where the performance is the actual burying of a hospital building?

Picturing the Brain

- Perspectives on Neuroimaging

   Neuroimaging enjoys an increasing prominence, not only among medical doctors, neuroscientists and philosophers, but in society at large. Brain images are deeply compelling, and are claimed to
   provide windows into the living brain. Yet what these images really show remains a debated issue. The research project Picturing the Brain: Perspectives on Neuroimaging (2010-2013) seeks to
   deepen our understanding of the epistemological roles neuroimaging technologies play in the conduct and communication of medicine and science. The primary objective is, more precisely, to
   develop a fine-grained understanding of socio-cultural and ethical issues that arise in relation to current applications of these technologies, as they are put to use as cognitive tools, as
   perceptual prostheses, and as visual rhetoric. The project is interdisciplinary and allows researchers with backgrounds in media studies, philosophy, digital media engineering, medical imaging,
   neuroscience, and creative arts to work together on specific tasks in varying configurations. The project is funded by the Research Council of Norway.

ArTe

   The ArTe research project  aims at enhancing the state of knowledge at the interdisciplinary intersection of software and the arts. The research questions explore the interplay between artwork,
   technology, artist, and audience. Sub-goals are:

   G1. Develop knowledge on the interdisciplinary nature of software production in which the software process interact with artistic process (i.e. the creation of heavily software-dependent
   artworks).

   G2. Support artists who utilize software for the creation of their artwork with software technology.

   We focus on technology such as Arduino, Processing, and Scratch, which enable broad audience to become makers of digital artistic expressions. ArTe researchers exploit well defined research
   methods, supported by qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis techniques, to design and execute valid research studies.

   The research is carried out at the Department of Computer and Information Science (IDI) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway. IDI has an established
   PhD program with 100 active PhD students.
