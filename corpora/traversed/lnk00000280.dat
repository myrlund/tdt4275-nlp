Chain Reaction

- By Elena Perez

   Chain Reaction is a hybrid form of pervasive game and interactive theater that investigates the challenges of combining ubiquitous computing and game design with theatre conventions. Perez uses
   game design as part of her research process in order to explore how participatory games can be used to enable alternative ways of engaging with theatre, more specifically how games together
   with new media applications can foster creative participation in artistic practices.

   Chain Reaction experiments with howto make participants engage artistically with others in public spaces, and ultimately create a short piece of theatre as a result of their interaction with
   the city. It was developed from August to October 2009 in the city of Berkeley, California, and orchestrated for the second time in Theaterhouse Avantgarden in Trondheim, Norway, in May 2011.


   Chain Reaction´s model is the following: Players meet in an specific place in the open, a park or a plaza, or inside a venue theatre house, where a narrative is delivered by actors who then
   explain the game rules and hand in maps and cellphones. In the map there are checkpoints marked. Players must go in groups of two and visit all the checkpoints. In each checkpoint there is an
   actor that delivers a task that players must complete. The tasks are about generating different pieces of artistic material - text, sound, movement and a theatre sculpture - resulting from the
   interaction with the environment. In the last checkpoint, teams re-group and the task is about devising a short piece of performance out of the materials they have collected. Every group
   performs its piece to the rest of participants -other players and the actors - and there is a vote to decide on the best show, who wins a symbolic trophy. Movement task: Participants were asked
   to perform a slow motion movement sequence while listening to music, at Trondheim torg, 2011. (Photo: Ingvild Aarseth)

   (Song mission: Participants were asked to engage in conversation with a stranger and get her to sing her favorite song. This team in Berkeley succeeded after trying for 20 minutes)
