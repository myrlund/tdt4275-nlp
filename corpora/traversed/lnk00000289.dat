Overarching goals and choices of direction

Internationally outstanding

   NTNU aims to become an outstanding university by international standards. This requires us to have world-class academic environments ourselves, and to seek collaboration with other leading
   knowledge communities in the world. In areas that are key to our mission in society, NTNU will take responsibility for building outstanding environments. We must set priorities for our
   resources so that we can provide development opportunities for the best teachers, researchers and academic groups, regardless of area.
   Our academic environments must concentrate their activities in order to create robust groups with quality at an international level. They must create adequate scope for the long-term basic
   research and take advantage of the opportunities that interdisciplinary collaboration provides to create unique results within their own subject. The academic environments must continue their
   close collaboration with the private and public sectors to develop the expertise that society needs.
   Motivated employees and students are a prerequisite to enable NTNU to achieve its objectives. Each individual has an independent responsibility to contribute to a fertile and favourable
   environment for work and learning, and to NTNU's efforts to fulfil its mission in society

Objectives

     * The entire organization upholds quality at a high international level and several academic environments are in the top international league, measured by international peer review.
     * NTNU has first-class laboratories and infrastructure for research and education.
     * Our main profile and unique attributes provide an advantage in academic competition at the national and international level, and in collaboration with private- and public-sector
       organizations.

Research and artistic activities

   The development of society depends on cultural renewal and research-based knowledge. An objective of research is to provide insight into technology, society and culture. Research must help to
   solve relevant problems and empower us to face the challenges of the future. Complex problems can be solved only with in-depth disciplinary knowledge and interdisciplinary collaboration. There
   must be a balance and interaction between applied and long-term basic research.
   NTNU's research and artistic activities are part of the international academic community, and all our academic environments have a responsibility to contribute actively to the development of
   subject areas and disciplines. As a knowledge nation, Norway must keep pace with international research, and as a large university we must aspire to leave a lasting impression.
   Internationalization is a prerequisite for development of high quality. Visibility at the national and international level makes us attractive for collaboration with the best players. This
   requires robust academic environments with a distinct profile, clear priorities, and disciplinary concentration. The environments must identify tomorrow's outstanding researchers and artists,
   and motivate students to pursue research. The doctoral programmes are a key instrument for renewing research and strengthening society's knowledge base.

Objectives

     * All research and artistic activities uphold a high international level, and several scientific and artistic environments are in the top international league.
     * The research environments have a distinct profile that supports education and innovation, and that takes advantage of interdisciplinary links.
     * The research is long-term and fundamental. It contributes to international development of knowledge and creates the basis for future innovation.
     * NTNU's doctoral programmes are in demand and maintain a high international standard

Education and learning environment

   There is a growing need for people with expertise who can tackle complex challenges in society. Competition for students is intensifying in the global education market; flexibility and ability
   to change are important. If we are to attract the most talented students and teaching staff, NTNU must take advantage of its unique attributes and develop a clear, ambitious profile for our
   academic portfolio. Studies must take place in a rich and inclusive learning environment. They must build on sound research and stimulate critical reflection and innovation.
   Alliances with strong academic environments at the national and international level create attractive programmes of study, increase the quality of the education and strengthen student mobility.
   Close dialogue with private- and public-sector organizations is needed to develop programmes of study that are relevant to society and to prepare students for the labour market they face both
   during and after their studies. The requirements for skills are changing continuously. This requires adapted learning activities and lifelong learning.
   Students must take responsibility for their own learning and be involved in the development of education programmes, teaching, and the learning environment. NTNU must provide students with
   close follow-up and evaluations that enhance learning. Leaders of education, teaching, and the learning environment must have clear roles and clear responsibility. The culture of quality
   improvement in the academic environments must be developed further, and the quality of education must be followed up continuously.

Objectives

     * NTNU's graduates have relevant and recognized expertise. They are in demand nationally and internationally.t
     * All the programmes of study are characterized by academic and teaching quality at a high international level.
     * The teaching stimulates students' critical reflection, and promotes interest in research and innovation.
     * NTNU has motivated students who are recruited nationally and internationally, and who can work across disciplinary boundaries and learning cultures.

The way forward

     * The studies will provide clear and documented qualifications for national and international working life.

     * We will offer teaching that has close links to research and innovation and that stimulates interdisciplinarity.
     * We will increase students' involvement in improvement of education quality and create a varied and favourable learning environment.
     * All academic environments will develop first-class educational management and a culture of quality improvement using systematic evaluation and effective follow-up.
     * We will increase the scope and quality of continuing and further education.

Innovation and creativity

   NTNU has helped to build the Norway of today. Our ambition is to be an even more important contributor to sustainable value creation in the future. We must stimulate increased innovation
   throughout the breadth of NTNU's subject areas. This is to be clearly reflected in the education that we offer. Our interdisciplinary profile and experience in collaboration with society and
   business provide NTNU with a competitive advantage in innovation.
   Our innovation activities arise from education, research and artistic work. The entire process from ideas to new products and services must function optimally, and capacity for the education of
   entrepreneurs must increase. In cooperation with other players, NTNU must establish the basis for more spin-off companies and development in existing enterprises.
   Effective innovation requires closer, stronger and more professionalized collaboration with the private and public sectors. A broad base of research forms the foundation for ideas that are
   useful to society and have potential for commercialization. We must strengthen interdisciplinary research on innovation processes, and encourage innovation among students and staff.

Objectives

     * NTNU is a driving force for adaptation and sustainable innovation in society.
     * NTNU is internationally outstanding within research-based innovation and collaboration with the private and public sectors.
     * Students and staff throughout NTNU's academic breadth participate in entrepreneurship and innovation.
     * NTNU has a well-functioning internal system for innovation, from ideas to spin-off companies.

The way forward

     * We will professionalize and develop external relationships internationally, nationally and regionally.
     * We will increase our research commitment to processes related to innovation and entrepreneurship.
     * Innovation activities at NTNU will emphasize interdisciplinarity and collaboration with business and society.
     * We will offer infrastructure and professional support functions for staff, students and spin-off companies.

Outreach and communication

   Universities must contribute to a knowledge-based public debate, convey insights, and provide the public with an understanding of the relevance of research.
   NTNU wishes to stimulate sound development of society through dissemination of knowledge and expertise. Our dissemination and communication will encompass knowledge, collections, art and
   culture. We take a specific responsibility for science and technology. Dissemination must reflect the constantly changing landscape of knowledge.
   Dissemination of research outputs to the public must take place in an open dialogue with society. Feedback from the outside world must have an impact on both research and education, thus
   increasing the relevance of our activities. The dissemination of research competes for attention in the information society. NTNU must develop and apply innovative approaches and media.
   Effective dissemination and communication strengthen the institution's reputation. This can help to recruit talented staff and students, and make us an attractive partner for business and
   knowledge institutions.

Objectives

     * Dissemination of knowledge is an integral part of NTNU's activities, and our students and staff are active contributors to public debate.

     * We will secure scientific collections and make them more accessible.
     * We will strengthen international dissemination and communication.
     * We will increase our endeavours to create a uniting NTNU identity among students, staff, and alumni.

Leadership, participation and resources

   Organization and resources must support our core activities. Better services, readily available information and good support systems contribute to this. NTNU must be responsible for an
   environmentally responsible operation.
   The operating context changes rapidly, and this imposes stringent requirements for good leadership and for the organization's adaptability. Leaders must make demanding strategic choices to
   develop our activities and establish the basis for an open, accepting and safe working environment. They have a specific responsibility to strengthen work on health, safety and the environment
   (HSE) at their units.
   An internationally outstanding university depends on the active involvement of students and staff. This requires inclusive leadership and effective collaboration with the student democracy and
   the employees' organizations.
   One of NTNU's great challenges is to recruit highly talented and motivated people to scientific and technical-administrative positions. In priority areas, we must seek staff members with
   expertise from internationally leading academic environments, and have suitable mechanisms for this. NTNU has a particular challenge in recruiting more women to technology and science.
