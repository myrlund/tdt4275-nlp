Information Division

   The Information Division at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) is responsible for the university's official internal and external communication. We are the contact point
   for local and international media, help the faculty publicize their research, organize large events, and work with community relations.

Find stories and experts

   NTNU's 2500 scientists and educators conduct research on everything from rural urban renewal in China to new forms of renewable energy. The Information Division can help members of the press
   find NTNU experts.
