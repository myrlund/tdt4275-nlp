PerFormativity

- Art, Communication and Knowledge Formation

   Performativityis a new interdisciplinary focus area at the Faculty of Humanities created to research the role of performativity in contemporary art, communication and knowledge formation.
   Through this research we aim to expand and challenge our understanding of the performative - of active intervention - in these fields. This focus area promotes interdisciplinarity, which
   consists on the meeting of practical work and theoretical reflexion.

- by Elena Perez

   This event took place in the streets of Trondheim in mai 2011 as a hybrid form of pervasive game and interactive theater, investigating the challenges of combining ubiquitous computing and game
   design with theatre conventions. Read morte here.
