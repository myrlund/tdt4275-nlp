About the project

- Performativity in Art, Communication and Knowledge Formation

   Performativity is an interdisciplinary focus area at the Faculty of Humanities created to research the role of performativity in contemporary art, communication and knowledge formation. Through
   this research we aim to expand and challenge our understanding of the performative - of active intervention - in these fields. This focus area promotes interdisciplinarity, which consists on
   the meeting of practical work and theoretical reflexion.

   We find the performative as «high tech» artistic practices that challenge established understandings of technology as purely instrumental and which even enter the realm of science by framing
   their projects as experiments. There is a clear focus on intervention and creativity within 'performance' and various forms of virtuality and games. Performativity as concept and as perspective
   challenges today established visions of knowledge formation and established understandings of the relationship between theory and practice, between scene and venue, between art and science.

   Performativity may denote specific traits of various forms of expression, but also deal with a particular perspective in all communication. In the former case performativity deals with, for
   instance, words that create what they name. Furthermore it deals with stagings, rituals and musical expression where what is created in the moment is prioritized over reenactment and
   representation. Understood as a more general perspective, performativity deals with bringing out the creative, constitutive and active in every concept and every expression. In this way
   performativity as perspective also deals with understanding staging as a basic condition for what it is to continuously be constituted as a subject.

   The creation of this focus area is an attempt from the Faculty of Humanities to 'make use of the potential for collaborative research across the boundaries of institutes and disciplines at the
   Faculty of Humanities to develop disciplinary quality, stimulate larger research projects and contribute to create a profile of the faculty, institutes and disciplinary environment'. The
   Faculty's concrete objectives are, among others, increasing academic publishing in relevant networks and the formation of research projects for applying to external research funding
   institutions on national and international levels. The priority of the performativity research area is to stimulate projects with new methodologies that address the intersection between
   theoretical and practical knowledge interests.
