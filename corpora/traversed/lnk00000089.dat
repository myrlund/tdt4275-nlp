Language requirements and courses

   NTNU is a Norwegian university with a strong international presence. That means our students and staff must be able to communicate clearly in English.

   English is a compulsory part of Norwegian schooling, so practically every Norwegian has a working knowledge of the language. And because English is very often the language of academic research,
   NTNU requires its ordinary degree students to be proficient in English as well as Norwegian. Exchange students, and students pursuing an international master's or PhD programme generally do not
   need to comply with the university's Norwegian requirement (although all are welcomed to learn Norwegian), but they do have to be able to speak English. Here's a summary of the university's
   language requirements:
     * English Proficiency Requirements at NTNU
     * English Proficiency Testing (TOEFL / IELTS)
     * Norwegian Requirements at NTNU (Degree seeking students)

   Learning Norwegian
   If you want to learn Norwegian, NTNU and other institutions offer various Norwegian language courses. Anyone who has been hired into a permanent position at NTNU who does not already speak
   Norwegian or another Scandinavian language is required to master Norwegian (or another Scandinavian language) within three years of his or her start date. This means being able to communicate
   at "level 3" (or the equivalent) of the Norwegian for Foreigners course given by the Department of Language and Communication Studies.
