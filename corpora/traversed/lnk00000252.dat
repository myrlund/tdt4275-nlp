Research

   Humanistic research is concerned with most areas related to what it means to be human, and how human beings think about themselves and their surrounding environment.


   Humanistic research plays a key role in the welfare and development of Norway. Growth, the formation of knowledge and wealth creation are often tied to distinctive features of the Norwegian
   society: A high level of education, democracy and social stability. Humanistic perspectives and values are important elements in this picture. Through the development and use of basic
   scientific research, and through the diversity of professional perspectives, the humanities contribute with essential expertise in order to respond to the important challenges faced by society.

   The humanities is concerned with what it broadly means to be human; identity, language, historical context and values. Humanistic research deals with areas as varied as language comprehension,
   archaeological explorations of pre-historic societies, the meaning of religion and religious rituals, and definitions of what constitutes good art.
