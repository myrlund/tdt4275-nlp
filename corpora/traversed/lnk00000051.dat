Housing for international master students

   The Office of International Relations at NTNU is responsible for allocating accommodation for international students. International students cannot book a room themselves at the Students
   Welfare Organization, SiT (Studentsamskipnaden i Trondheim). All new international master students who have been accepted will receive information about housing from the Office of International
   Relations after they have been accepted at NTNU.

   International master students accepted at NTNU, will automatically be considered for housing in a single room (unless the student specifies to us that he will arrange for housing on his own).
   International students should not, under any circumstances, contact SiT about housing before receiving a housing contract directly from SiT
   The Students Welfare Organization, SiT is a non-profit organization led by the students through their majority in the board. 30% of the rooms in the student villages will be allocated to
   international students. NTNU has to relate to this rule and we must therefore prioritize who will get student housing.
   Priority will be given to new international master students.
   Please see the following webpage for important information for students allocated a room at the student village:
   http://www.ntnu.edu/studies/for-students-allocated-housing-at-the-student-village-sit

   International master students who decline the offer of housing, arrange for private accommodation or move out of SiT's student village into a private room  etc. cannot expect to be allocated
   housing again at SiT. SiT has a rule that students cannot move in again at the same student village and same type of room until at least 6 months after they move out. We will also give priority
   to new students, which means that students already living in Trondheim will not be prioritized.
   Students who have to find private housing may find more information here: http://www.ntnu.edu/studies/searching-for-private-housing
   Students going for a whole exchange semester abroad
   If you are an international master student living at the student village and will go abroad for an entire exchange semester you should do the following:
   - contact housing@adm.ntnu.no and inform us how long you are planning to be gone from NTNU
   - After this: cancel your housing contract with SiT. Remember that you have to give one months' notice. After your contract is cancelled, your housing deposit will be transferred back to your
   account.
   - Please inform the Office of International Relations to book a new room for you by contacting housing@adm.ntnu.no. If you plan on coming back to NTNU in the spring semester, contact us by
   sending us an e-mail in November. If you come back in the fall semester, please send us an e-mail in June.

   Please note that students going for field work for a few months should not cancel their room at the student village. Only students who will be away for a whole semester may cancel their room
   and move back in again at another room at the student village.
   Students who want to prolong their housing contract
   The Office of International Relations is responsible for contacting SiT about extension of housing contracts for international students. Please do not contact SiT directly about this.

   Due to the difficult housing situation for students in Trondheim, and the fact that new students arriving in August are prioritized, we will not be able to offer accommodation at the student
   village for fall 2012. This means that if you are delayed in your studies and require an extension of your study right, you will have to find private accommodation. Please contact
   housing@adm.ntnu.no before April 1^st if your contract expires in the end of June and you have to prolong your contract.

   In case an extension of your housing contract is approved you are unfortunately not guaranteed to keep the same room/apartment for your extension period.

   Please also present a confirmation from your supervisor regarding the extension of your studies if your studies will be extended longer than July 30th. Give the confirmation to the program
   coordinator (Oddrun Maaø oddrun.maao@ntnu.no for self financed student and Anette Moen anette.moen@ntnu.no for Quota students )
   Once the fall semster starts we have a lot of new students arriving and we cannot prolong your contract after this date unless you are delayed because of medical reasons.

   If you are delayed because of medical reasons, we will in each case consider whether we can extend your accommodation if we receive confirmation from your doctor.
