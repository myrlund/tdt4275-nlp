Erasmus Mundus master's programmes

   Erasmus Mundus is a programme that aims to enhance the quality of higher education in Europe by promoting dialogue and understanding between people and cultures through mobility and academic
   cooperation. Erasmus Mundus is open to both European and non-European students, and there are generous scholarships and funding opportunities available.
   Each master's programme is organised by a consortium of at least three specialised universities in different European countries. Some programmes also include universities from non-European
   countries. Based on their scientific interest, students follow a mobility path where they attend two or more of the participating universities. All Erasmus Mundus degree programmes are
   recognised by the European Commission, and students will receive a double, multiple or joint degree.
   For general information about Erasmus Mundus see the FAQ on the official European Commission's Erasmus Mundus homepage. For information about the Erasmus Mundus master's programmes at NTNU,
