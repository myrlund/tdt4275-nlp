Searching for private housing

   Students who are not allocated housing at SiT will have to find private accommodation on their own. The Office of International Relations has information about all students that are not
   allocated housing and it is not necessary to contact us about this.

   Finding a place to live in Trondheim can be a challenge, especially for students who want to live close to NTNU and/or the center of Trondheim. Rooms close to NTNU are popular and more
   expensive than rooms located in the suburbs (for example suburbs like Ranheim, Vikåsen, Kolstad, Tiller and Heimdal) and we therefore advise students to look for private accommodation in the
   suburbs. Rooms close to NTNU / the centre of Trondheim cost from approximately NOK 4500,- per month. Electricity is usually not included in the monthly rent. This means that if you find
   something around this price you should accept it.
   Experience has shown that it is easier to find housing in the spring, both in the student villages and in the private market in Trondheim and it might therefore be an idea to consider coming to
   NTNU in the spring rather than the fall semester if possible. For information about vacant rooms/apartments please visit these web pages:

   www.Innsida.ntnu.no
   www.finn.no
   www.hybel.no
   www.easyroommate.com

   If you need general information about the private housing market in Trondheim, you may contact the Housing assistance: http://www.velferdstinget.no/2012/boligassistanse/ or the Office of
   International Relations at this address: housing@adm.ntnu.no.

   FAQ

   1) What should I do?
   The most important thing is to call or send a SMS to the owner of the appartement you find. They receive a lot of emails, so your chances are much higher if you call. Second, you should put in
   your own ad, at least in www.hybel.no that is free :)

   2) What do I have to pay
   Close to the campus you should be happy if you find something around 4300 NOK, I know this is expensive, but that is the reality. A Little further away (15 min with bus) you should be able to
   find something for around 3300 NOK.

   3) What is best, one person or a group
   It is allmost allways best to be a group, then the houseowner can keep in touch with one of you and less work for him/her

   4) What do the Office of International relations do to help
    1. We have contacted over 4000 NTNU Alumni about the housing situation and our hope is that some of them have a vacant room for you.
    2. We work with the housing assistance
    3. We try to find big appartements houses in town which we can offer you

   5 How many students arrive each year and how many receive housing
   We expect that around 1300 international students will come in August and we only have housing for around 925, first all the students from outside EU/EØS receive housing because they need it to
   enter the Country. After that there is around 325 left for the 700 students from EU/EØS. Most of that is given to the students who are attending the Language couse, but some are left to you.
   And I expect that maybe as many as 100 of the students who have allready received housing will cancel it, so there is still a small hope

   For students arriving in the fall semester:
   Students arriving in Trondheim in the fall semester are guaranteed to have a bed available for a short period at "Roof Over Your Head". This offer opens August 11th and is for students who are
   not allocated a room at SiT and must find private housing on their own. Please see the following website for further information (the webpage will be updated during spring/summer):
   http://www.studiebyen.no/en/housing-assistance/roof-over-your-head


   If you arrive before August 11th, you may arrange for temporary housing at Trondheim Interrail Center.
   Due to a huge conferance in week 33 it will be very difficult to get a room at any hotel in Trondheim during this week.
   Please inform the Office of International Relations at housing@adm.ntnu.no once you manage to find a room in the private market.
