NTNU's Quota Scheme Agreements

   The Norwegian Quota Scheme is a funding Scheme offered by the Norwegian Government to students from developing countries in the South and countries in the Western Balkans, Eastern Europe and in
   Central Asia

   For admission under the Quota Scheme, NTNU will only consider candidates with a connection to one of NTNU's formal cooperation agreements. If your institution is not on the list, NTNU does NOT
   have an agreement with your institution or the agreement has expired. To renew or initiate an agreement you need to contact your relevant department/faculty/school at your home institution.

   Applicants will be asked to indicate that they belong to at least one of the following categories in the electronic preliminary application to be able to proceed with their application:
    1. Permanently employed at one of NTNU's collaborating institutions
    2. Temporary employed at one of NTNU's collaborating institutions
    3. Presently studying at one of NTNU's collaborating institutions
    4. Graduates with a first degree from one of NTNU's collaborating institutions

   Please note that there are no Quota Scheme places at NTNU available to PhD students for the 2013-2014 academic year.
